       "'April Fools\\n   Abandon all hope ye who enter here is scrawled in blood red lettering on the side of the Chemical Bank near the corner of Eleventh and First and is in print large enough to be seen from the backseat of the cab as it lurches forward in the traffic leaving Wall Street and just as Timothy Price notices the words a bus pulls up the advertisement forLes Misrableson its side blocking his view but Price who is with Pierce Pierce and twentysix doesnt seem to care because he tells the driver he will give him five dollars to turn up the radio Be My Baby on WYNN and the driver black not American does so\\n   Im resourceful Price is saying Im creative Im young unscrupulous highly motivated highly skilled In essence what Im saying is that society cannotafford to lose me Im anasset Price calms down continues to stare out the cabs dirty window probably at the word FEAR sprayed in red graffiti on the side of a McDonalds on Fourth and Seventh I mean the fact remains that no one gives a shit about their work everybody hates their jobI hate my jobyouvetold me you hate yours What do I do Go back to Los AngelesNotan alternative I didnt transfer from UCLA to Stanford to put up with this I mean am Ialonein thinking were not making enough money Like in a movie another bus appears another poster forLes Misrablesreplaces the word not the same bus because someone has written the word DYKE over Eponines face Tim blurts out I have a coop here I have a place in theHamptons for Christ sakes\\n   Parents guy Its the parents\\n   Imbuying it from them Will you fucking turn thisup he snaps but distractedly at the driver the Crystals still blaring from the radio\\n   It dont go up no higher maybe the driver says\\n   Timothy ignores him and irritably continues I could stay living in this city if they just installed Blaupunkts in the cabs Maybe the ODM III or ORC II dynamic tuning systems His voice softens here Either one Hip my friend very hip\\n   He takes off the expensivelooking Walkman from around his neck still complaining I hate to complain I really do  about the trash the garbage the disease about how filthy this city really is and you know and I know that it is asty He continues talking as he opens his new Tumi calfskin attach case he bought at D F Sanders He places the Walkman in the case alongside a Panasonic walletsize cordless portable folding Easaphone he used to own the NEC  Porta portable and pulls out todays newspaper In one issue  inoneissue lets see here strangled models babies thrown from tenement rooftops kids killed in the subway a Communist rally Mafia boss wiped out Nazis  he flips through the pages excitedly  baseball players with AIDS more Mafia shit gridlock the homeless various maniacs faggots dropping like flies in the streets surrogate mothers the cancellation of a soap opera kids who broke into a zoo and tortured and burned various animals alive more Nazis and the joke is the punch line is its all in this city  nowhere else just here it sucks whoa wait more Nazis gridlock gridlock babysellers blackmarket babies AIDS babies baby junkies building collapses on baby maniac baby gridlock bridge collapses His voice stops he takes in a breath and then quietly says his eyes fixed on a beggar at the corner of Second and Fifth Thats the twentyfourth one Ive seen today Ive kept count Then asks without looking over Why arent you wearing the worsted navy blue blazer with the gray pants Price is wearing a sixbutton wool and silk suit by Ermenegildo Zegna a cotton shirt with French cuffs by Ike Behar a Ralph Lauren silk tie and leather wing tips by Fratelli Rossetti Pan down to thePost There is a moderately interesting story concerning two people who disappeared at a party aboard the yacht of a seminoted New York socialite while the boat was circling the island A residue of spattered blood and three smashed champagne glasses are the only clues Foul play is suspected and police think that perhaps a machete was the killers weapon because of certain grooves and indentations found on the deck No bodies have been found There are no suspects Price began his spiel today over lunch and then brought it up again during the squash game and continued ranting over drinks at Harrys where he had gone on over three JBs and water much more interestingly about the Fisher account that Paul Owen is handling Price will not shut up\\n   Diseases he exclaims his face tense with pain Theres this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through havingsexwith someone who isinfected then you can also catchanything whether its a virus per se or not Alzheimers muscular dystrophy hemophilia leukemia anorexia diabetes cancer multiple sclerosis cystic fibrosis cerebral palsy dyslexia for Christ sakes  you can get dyslexia frompussy\\n   Im not sure guy but I dont think dyslexia is a virus\\n   Oh who knowsTheydont know that Prove it\\n   Outside this cab on the sidewalks black and bloated pigeons fight over scraps of hot dogs in front of a Grays Papaya while transvestites idly look on and a police car cruises silently the wrong way down a oneway street and the sky is low and gray and in a cab thats stopped in traffic across from this one a guy who looks a lot like Luis Carruthers waves over at Timothy and when Timothy doesnt return the wave the guy slickedback hair suspenders hornrimmed glasses  realizes its not who he thought it was and looks back at his copy ofUSA Today Panning down to the sidewalk theres an ugly old homeless bag lady holding a whip and she cracks it at the pigeons who ignore it as they continue to peck and fight hungrily over the remains of the hot dogs and the police car disappears into an underground parking lot\\n   But then when youve just come to the point when your reaction to the times is one of total and sheer acceptance when your body has become somehowtunedinto the insanity and you reach that point where it all makes sense when it clicks we get some crazy fucking homeless nigger who actuallywants listen to me Bateman wantsto be out on the streets thisthose streets seethose he points  and we have a mayor who wont listen to her a mayor who wont let thebitchhave her way Holy Christ  let the fucking bitchfreezeto death put her out of her own goddamn selfmade misery and look youre back where you started confused fucked Number twentyfour nope twentyfive Whos going to be at Evelyns Wait let me guess He holds up a hand attached to an impeccable manicure Ashley Courtney Muldwyn Marina Charles  am I right so far Maybe one of Evelyns artiste friends from ohmygod the East Village You know the type  the ones who ask Evelyn if she has a nice drywhitechardonnay He slaps a hand over his forehead and shuts his eyes and now he mutters jaw clenched Im leaving Im dumping Meredith Shes essentiallydaringme to like her Im gone Why did it take me so long to realize that she has all the personality of a goddamn gameshow host Twentysix twentyseven I mean I tell her Im sensitive I told her I was freaked out by theChallengeraccident what more does she want Im ethical tolerant I mean Im extremely satisfied with my life Im optimistic about the future  I mean arent you\\n   Sure but\\n   And all I get isshitfrom her Twentyeight twentynine holy shit its a goddamnclusterof bums I tell you He stops suddenly as if exhausted and turning away from another advertisement forLes Misrables remembering something important asks Did you read about the host from that game show on TV He killed two teenage boys Depraved faggot Droll really droll Price waits for a reaction There is none Suddenly Upper West Side\\n   He tells the driver to stop on the corner of Eightyfirst and Riverside since the street doesnt go the right way\\n   Dont bother going arou Price begins\\n   Maybe I go other way around the cabdriver says\\n   Do not bother Then barely an aside teeth gritted unsmiling Fucking nitwit\\n   The driver brings the cab to a stop Two cabs behind this cab both blare their horns then move on\\n   Should we bring flowers\\n   Nah Hellyourebanging her Bateman Why shouldwegetEvelynflowers You better have change for a fifty he warns the driver squinting at the red numbers on the meter Damnit Steroids Sorry Im tense\\n   Thought you were off them\\n   Iwasgetting acne on my legs and arms and the UVA bath wasnt fixing it so I started going to a tanning salon instead and got rid of it Jesus Bateman you should see howrippedmy stomach is The definition Completely buffed out he says in a distant odd way while waiting for the driver to hand him the change Ripped He stiffs the driver on the tip but the driver is genuinely thankful anyway So long Shlomo Price winks\\n   Damn damn damned Price says as he opens the door Coming out of the cab he eyes a beggar on the street Bingothirty wearing some sort of weird tacky filthy green jump suit unshaven dirty hair greased back and jokingly Price holds the cabs door open for him The bum confused and mumbling eyes locked shamefully on the pavement holds an empty Styrofoam coffee cup out to us clutched in a tentative hand\\n   I suppose he doesnt want the cab Price snickers slamming the cab door Ask him if he takes American Express\\n   Do you take Am Ex\\n   The bum nods yes and moves away shuffling slowly\\n   Its cold for April and Price walks briskly down the street toward Evelyns brownstone whistling If I Were a Rich Man the heat from his mouth creating smoky plumes of steam and swinging his Tumi leather attach case A figure with slickedback hair and hornrimmed glasses approaches in the distance wearing a beige doublebreasted woolgabardine Cerruti  suit and carrying the same Tumi leather attach case from D F Sanders that Price has and Timothy wonders aloud Is it Victor Powell It cantbe\\n   The man passes under the fluorescent glare of a streetlamp with a troubled look on his face that momentarily curls his lips into a slight smile and he glances at Price almost as if they were acquainted but just as quickly he realizes that he doesnt know Price and just as quickly Price realizes its not Victor Powell and the man moves on\\n   Thank god Price mutters as he nears Evelyns\\n   It looked a lot like him\\n   Powellanddinner at Evelyns These two go together about as well as paisley and plaid Price rethinks this White socks with gray trousers\\n   A slow dissolve and Price is bounding up the steps outside the brownstone Evelyns father bought her grumbling about how he forgot to return the tapes he rented last night to Video Haven He rings the bell At the brownstone next to Evelyns a woman high heels great ass  leaves without locking her door Price follows her with his gaze and when he hears footsteps from inside coming down the hallway toward us he turns around and straightens his Versace tie ready to face whoever Courtney opens the door and shes wearing a Krizia cream silk blouse a Krizia rust tweed skirt and silksatin dOrsay pumps from Manolo Blahnik\\n   I shiver and hand her my black wool Giorgio Armani overcoat and she takes it from me carefully airkissing my right cheek then she performs the same exact movements on Price while taking his Armani overcoat The new Talking Heads on CD plays softly in the living room\\n   A bit late arent we boys Courtney asks smiling naughtily\\n   Inept Haitian cabbie Price mutters airkissing Courtney back Do we have reservations somewhere and please dont tell me Pastels at nine\\n   Courtney smiles hanging up both coats in the hall closet Eating in tonight darlings Im sorry I know I know I tried to talk Evelyn out of it but were havingsushi\\n   Tim moves past her and down the foyer toward the kitchen Evelyn Whereareyou Evelyn he calls out in a singsong voice We have totalk\\n   Its good to see you I tell Courtney You look very pretty tonight Your face has a youthful glow\\n   You really know how to charm the ladies Bateman There is no sarcasm in Courtneys voice Should I tell Evelyn you feel this way she asks flirtatiously\\n   No I say But I bet youd like to\\n   Come on she says taking my hands off her waist and placing her hands on my shoulders steering me down the hall in the direction of the kitchen We have to save Evelyn Shes been rearranging the sushi for the past hour Shes trying to spell your initials theP in yellowtail theBin tuna but she thinks the tuna looks too pale\\n   How romantic\\n   and she doesnt have enough yellowtail to finish theB Courtney breathes in  and so I think shes going to spell Tims initials instead Do you mind she asks only a bit worried Courtney is Luis Carruthers girlfriend\\n   Im terribly jealous and I think I better talk to Evelyn I say letting Courtney gently push me into the kitchen\\n   Evelyn stands by a blond wood counter wearing a Krizia cream silk blouse a Krizia rust tweed skirt and the same pair of silksatin dOrsay pumps Courtney has on Her long blond hair is pinned back into a rather severelooking bun and she acknowledges me without looking up from the oval Wilton stainlesssteel platter on which she has artfully arranged the sushi Oh honey Im sorry I wanted to go to this darling little new Salvadorian bistro on the Lower East Side\\n   Price groans audibly\\n   but we couldnt get reservations Timothydont groan She picks up a piece of the yellowtail and places it cautiously near the top of the platter completing what looks like a capitalT She stands back from the platter and inspects it I dont know Oh Im so unsure\\n   I told you to keepFinlandiain this place Tim mutters looking through the bottles most of them magnums  at the bar She never has Finlandia he says to no one to all of us\\n   Oh godTimothy Cant handleAbsolut Evelyn asks and then contemplatively to Courtney The California roll should circle the rim of the plate no\\n   Bateman Drink Price sighs\\n   JB rocks I tell him suddenly thinking its strange that Meredith wasnt invited\\n   Oh god Its amess Evelyn gasps I swear Im going tocry\\n   The sushi looksmarvelous I tell her soothingly\\n   Oh its amess she wails Its amess\\n   No no the sushi looksmarvelous I tell her and in an attempt to be as consoling as possible I pick up a piece of the fluke and pop it in my mouth groaning with inward pleasure and hug Evelyn from behind my mouth still full I manage to say Delicious\\n   She slaps at me in a playful way obviously pleased with my reaction and finally carefully airkisses my cheek and then turns back to Courtney Price hands me a drink and walks toward the living room while trying to remove something invisible from his blazer Evelyn do you have a lint brush\\n   I would rather have watched the baseball game or gone to the gym and worked out or tried that Salvadorian restaurant that got a couple of pretty good reviews one inNew Yorkmagazine the other in theTimes than have dinner here but there is one good thing about dinner at Evelyns its close to my place\\n   Is it okay if the soy sauce isnt exactly at room temperature Courtney is asking I think theres ice in one of the dishes\\n   Evelyn is placing strips of pale orange ginger delicately in a pile next to a small porcelain dish filled with soy sauce No its not okay Now Patrick could you be a dear and get the Kirin out of the refrigerator Then seemingly harassed by the ginger she throws the clump down on the platter Oh forget itIlldo it\\n   I move toward the refrigerator anyway Staring darkly Price reenters the kitchen and says Who in the hell is in the living room\\n   Evelyn feigns ignorance Oh who is that\\n   Courtney warns Evelyn Youdidtell them I hope\\n   Who is it I ask suddenly scared Victor Powell\\n   No its not Victor Powell Patrick Evelyn says casually Its an artist friend of mine Stash And Vanden his girlfriend\\n   Oh so that was agirlin there Price says Go take a look Bateman he dares Let me guess The East Village\\n   Oh Price she says flirtatiously opening beer bottles Why no Vanden goes to Camden and Stash lives in SoHo so there\\n   I move out of the kitchen past the dining room where the table has been set the beeswax candles from Zona lit in their sterling silver candleholders from Fortunoff and into the living room I cant tell what Stash is wearing since its all black Vanden has green streaks in her hair She stares at a heavymetal video playing on MTV while smoking a cigarette\\n   Ahem I cough\\n   Vanden looks over warily probably drugged to the eyeballs Stash doesnt move\\n   Hi Pat Bateman I say offering my hand noticing my reflection in a mirror hung on the wall and smiling at how good I look\\n   She takes it says nothing Stash starts smelling his fingers\\n   Smash cut and Im back in the kitchen\\n   Just get her out of there Price is seething Shes doped up watching MTV and I want to watch the goddamn MacNeilLehrer report\\n   Evelyn is still opening large bottles of imported beer and absently mentions Weve got to eat this stuff soon or else were all going to be poisoned\\n   Shes got a green streak in her hair I tell them Andshes smoking\\n   Bateman Tim says still glaring at Evelyn\\n   Yes I say Timothy\\n   Youre a dufus\\n   Oh leave Patrick alone Evelyn says Hes the boy next door Thats Patrick Youre not a dufus are you honey Evelyn is on Mars and I move toward the bar to make myself another drink\\n   Boy next door Tim smirks and nods then reverses his expression and hostilely asks Evelyn again if she has a lint brush\\n   Evelyn finishes opening the Japanese beer bottles and tells Courtney to fetch Stash and Vanden We have to eat this now or else were going to be poisoned she murmurs slowly moving her head taking in the kitchen making sure she hasnt forgotten anything\\n   If I can tear them away from the latest Megadeth video Courtney says before exiting\\n   I have to talk to you Evelyn says\\n   What about I come up to her\\n   No she says and then pointing at Tim to Price\\n   Tim still glares at her fiercely I say nothing and stare at Tims drink\\n   Be a hon she tells me and place the sushi on the table Tempura is in the microwave and the sake is just about done boiling Her voice trails off as she leads Price out of the kitchen\\n   I am wondering where Evelyn got the sushi the tuna yellowtail mackerel shrimp eel evenbonitoall seem so fresh and there are piles of wasabi and clumps of ginger placed strategically around the Wilton platter but I also like the idea that I dontknow willneverknow will neveraskwhere it came from and that the sushi will sit there in the middle of the glass table from Zona that Evelyns father bought her like some mysterious apparition from the Orient and as I set the platter down I catch a glimpse of my reflection on the surface of the table My skin seems darker because of the candlelight and I notice how good the haircut I got at Gios last Wednesday looks I make myself another drink I worry about the sodium level in the soy sauce\\n   Four of us sit around the table waiting for Evelyn and Timothy to return from getting Price a lint brush I sit at the head taking large swallows of JB Vanden sits at the other end reading disinterestedly from some East Village rag calledDeceptionits glaring headline THE DEATH OF DOWNTOWN Stash has pushed a chopstick into a lone piece of yellowtail that lies on the middle of his plate like some shiny impaled insect and the chopstick stands straight up Stash occasionally moves the piece of sushi around the plate with the chopstick but never looks up toward either myself or Vanden or Courtney who sits next to me sipping plum wine from a champagne glass\\n   Evelyn and Timothy come back perhaps twenty minutes after weve seated ourselves and Evelyn looks only slightly flushed Tim glares at me as he takes the seat next to mine a fresh drink in hand and he leans over toward me about to say to admit something when suddenly Evelyn interrupts Not there Timothy then barely a whisper Boy girl boy girl She gestures toward the empty chair next to Vanden Timothy shifts his glare to Evelyn and hesitantly takes the seat next to Vanden who yawns and turns a page of her magazine\\n   Well everybody Evelyn says smiling pleased with the meal she has presented dig in and then after noticing the piece of sushi that Stash has pinned hes now bent low over the plate whispering at it  her composure falters but she smiles bravely and chirps Plum wine anyone\\n   No one says anything until Courtney who is staring at Stashs plate lifts her glass uncertainly and says trying to smile Its delicious Evelyn\\n   Stash doesnt speak Even though he is probably uncomfortable at the table with us since he looks nothing like the other men in the room his hair isnt slicked back no suspenders no hornrimmed glasses the clothes black and illfitting no urge to light and suck on a cigar probably unable to secure a table at Camols his net worth a pittance  still his behavior lacks warrant and he sits there as if hypnotized by the glistening piece of sushi and just as the table is about to finally ignore him to look away and start eating he sits up and loudly says pointing an accusing finger at his plate It moved\\n   Timothy glares at him with a contempt so total that I cant fully equal it but I muster enough energy to come close Vanden seems amused and so now unfortunately does Courtney who Im beginning to think finds this monkey attractive but I suppose if I were dating Luis Carruthers I might too Evelyn laughs goodnaturedly and says Oh Stash youarea riot and then asks worriedly Tempura Evelyn is an executive at a financial services company FYI\\n   Ill have some I tell her and I lift a piece of eggplant off the platter though I wont eat it because its fried\\n   The table begins to serve themselves successfully ignoring Stash I stare at Courtney as she chews and swallows\\n   Evelyn in an attempt to start a conversation says after what seems like a long thoughtful silence Vanden goes to Camden\\n   Oh really Timothy asks icily Where is that\\n   Vermont Vanden answers without looking up from her paper\\n   I look over at Stash to see if hes pleased with Vandens casually blatant lie but he acts as if he wasnt listening as if he were in some other room or somepunk rockclub in the bowels of the city but so does the rest of the table which bothers me since I am fairly sure we all know its located in New Hampshire\\n   Where didyougo Vanden sighs after it finally becomes clear to her that no one is interested in Camden\\n   Well I went to Le Rosay Evelyn starts and then to business school in Switzerland\\n   I also survived business school in Switzerland Courtney says But I was in Geneva Evelyn was in Lausanne\\n   Vanden tosses the copy ofDeceptionnext to Timothy and smirks in a wan bitchy way and though I am pissed off a little that Evelyn doesnt take in Vandens condescension and hurl it back at her the JB has relieved my stress to a point where I dont care enough to say anything Evelyn probably thinks Vanden is sweet lost confused an artist Price isnt eating and neither is Evelyn I suspect cocaine but its doubtful While taking a large gulp from his drink Timothy holds up the copy of Deceptionand chuckles to himself\\n   The Death of Downtown he says then pointing at each word in the headline Whogivesaratsass\\n   I automatically expect Stash to look up from his plate but he still stares at the lone piece of sushi smiling to himself and nodding\\n   Hey Vanden says as if she was insulted Thataffects us\\n   Oh ho ho Tim says warningly Thataffects us What about the massacres in Sri Lanka honey Doesnt that affect us too What about Sri Lanka\\n   Well thats a cool club in the Village Vanden shrugs Yeah that affects us too\\n   Suddenly Stash speaks without looking up Thats called TheTonka He sounds pissed but his voice is even and low his eyes still on the sushi Its called The Tonka not Sri Lanka Got it The Tonka\\n   Vanden looks down then meekly says Oh\\n   I mean dont you know anything about Sri Lanka About how the Sikhs are killing like tons of Israelis there Timothy goads her Doesntthataffect us\\n   Kappamaki roll anyone Evelyn cuts in cheerfully holding up a plate\\n   Oh come on Price I say There are more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about Sure our foreign policy is important but thereare more pressing problems at hand\\n   Like what he asks without looking away from Vanden By the way why is there an ice cube in my soy sauce\\n   No I start hesitantly Well we have to end apartheid for one And slow down the nuclear arms race stop terrorism and world hunger Ensure a strong national defense prevent the spread of communism in Central America work for a Middle East peace settlement prevent US military involvement overseas We have to ensure that America is a respected world power Now thats not to belittle our domestic problems which are equally important if notmore Better and more affordable longterm care for the elderly control and find a cure for the AIDS epidemic clean up environmental damage from toxic waste and pollution improve the quality of primary and secondary education strengthen laws to crack down on crime and illegal drugs We also have to ensure that college education is affordable for the middle class and protect Social Security for senior citizens plus conserve natural resources and wilderness areas and reduce the influence of political action committees\\n   The table stares at me uncomfortably even Stash but Im on a roll\\n   But economically were still a mess We have to find a way to hold down the inflation rate and reduce the deficit We also need to provide training and jobs for the unemployed as well as protect existing American jobs from unfair foreign imports We have to make America the leader in new technology At the same time we need to promote economic growth and business expansionandhold the line against federal income taxes and hold down interest rates while promoting opportunities for small businesses and controlling mergers and big corporate takeovers\\n   Price nearly spits up his Absolut after this comment but I try to make eye contact with each one of them especially Vanden who if she got rid of the green streak and the leather and got some color maybe joined an aerobics class slipped on a blouse something by Laura Ashley mightbe pretty But why does she sleep with Stash Hes lumpy and pale and has a bad cropped haircut and is at least ten pounds overweight theres no muscle tone beneath the black Tshirt\\n   But we cant ignore our social needs either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain womens freedom of choice We also have to control the influx of illegal immigrants We have to encourage a return to traditional moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on TV in movies in popular music everywhere Most importantly we have to promote general social concern and less materialism in young people\\n   I finish my drink The table sits facing me in total silence Courtneys smiling and seems pleased Timothy just shakes his head in bemused disbelief Evelyn is completely mystified by the turn the conversation has taken and she stands unsteadily and asks if anyone would like dessert\\n   I have sorbet she says as if in a daze Kiwi carambola cherimoya cactus fruit and oh what is that She stops her zombie monotone and tries to remember the last flavor Oh yes Japanese pear\\n   Everyone stays silent Tim quickly looks over at me I glance at Courtney then back at Tim then at Evelyn Evelyn meets my glance then worriedly looks over at Tim I also look over at Tim then at Courtney and then at Tim again who looks at me once more before answering slowly unsurely Cactus pear\\n   Cactusfruit Evelyn corrects\\n   I look suspiciously over at Courtney and after she says Cherimoya I say Kiwi and then Vanden says Kiwi also and Stash says quietly but enunciating each syllable very clearly Chocolate chip\\n   The worry that flickers across Evelyns face when she hears this is instantaneously replaced by a smiling and remarkably goodnatured mask and she says Oh Stash you know I dont have chocolate chip though admittedly thats prettyexoticfor a sorbet I told you I have cherimoya cactus pear carambola Imean cactusfruit\\n   I know I heard you I heard you he says waving her off Surprise me\\n   Okay Evelyn says Courtney Would you like to help\\n   Of course Courtney gets up and I watch as her shoes click away into the kitchen\\n   No cigars boys Evelyn calls out\\n   Wouldnt dream of it Price says putting a cigar back into his coat pocket\\n   Stash is still staring at the sushi with an intensity that troubles me and I have to ask him hoping he will catch my sarcasm Did it uh move again or something\\n   Vanden has made a smiley face out of all the disks of California roll she piled onto her plate and she holds it up for Stashs inspection and asks Rex\\n   Cool Stash grunts\\n   Evelyn comes back with the sorbet in Odeon margarita glasses and an unopened bottle of Glenfiddich which remains unopened while we eat the sorbet\\n   Courtney has to leave early to meet Luis at a company party at Bedlam a new club in midtown Stash and Vanden depart soon after to go score something somewhere in SoHo I am the only one who saw Stash take the piece of sushi from his plate and slip it into the pocket of his olive green leather bomber jacket When I mention this to Evelyn while she loads the dishwasher she gives me a look so hateful that it seems doubtful we will have sex later on tonight But I stick around anyway So does Price He is now lying on a lateeighteenthcentury Aubusson carpet drinking espresso from a Ceralene coffee cup on the floor of Evelyns room Im lying on Evelyns bed holding a tapestry pillow from Jenny B Goode nursing a cranberry and Absolut Evelyn sits at her dressing table brushing her hair a Ralph Lauren green and white striped silk robe draped over a very nice body and she is gazing at her reflection in the vanity mirror\\n   Am I the only one who grasped the fact that Stash assumed his piece of sushi was I cough then resume  a pet\\n   Please stop inviting your artiste friends over Tim says tiredly Im sick of being the only one at dinner who hasnt talked to an extraterrestrial\\n   It was only thatonce Evelyn says inspecting a lip lost is her own placid beauty\\n   And at Odeon no less Price mutters\\n   I vaguely wonder why I wasnt invited to Odeon for the artists dinner Had Evelyn picked up the tab Probably And I suddenly picture a smiling Evelyn secretly morose sitting at a whole table of Stashs friends all of them constructing little log cabins with their french fries or pretending their grilled salmon was alive and moving the piece of fish around the table the fish conversing with each other about the art scene new galleries maybe even trying to fit the fish into the log cabin made of french fries\\n   If you remember well enoughI hadnt seen one either Evelyn says\\n   No but Batemans your boyfriend so that counted Price guffaws and I toss the pillow at him He catches it then throws it back at me\\n   Leave Patrick alone Hes the boy next door Evelyn says rubbing some kind of cream into her face Youre not an extraterrestrial are you honey\\n   Should I even dignify that question with an answer I sigh\\n   Oh baby She pouts into the mirror looking at me in its reflection I know youre not an extraterrestrial\\n   Relief I mutter to myself\\n   No but Stash was there at Odeon that night Price continues and then looking over at me At Odeon Are you listening Bateman\\n   No hewasnt Evelyn says\\n   Oh yes hewas but his name wasnt Stash last time It wasHorseshoeorMagnetorLegoor somethingequallyadult Price sneers I forget\\n   Timothy whatareyou going on about Evelyn asks tiredly Im not even listening to you She wets a cotton ball wipes it across her forehead\\n   No we were at Odeon Price sits up with some effort And dont ask me why but I distinctly remember him ordering the tunacappuccino\\n   Carpaccio Evelyn corrects\\n   No Evelyn dear love of my life I distinctly remember him ordering the tunacappuccino Price says staring up at the ceiling\\n   He said carpaccio she counters running the cotton ball over her eyelids\\n   Cappuccino Price insists Until youcorrected him\\n   Youdidnt even recognize him earlier tonight she says\\n   Oh but Idoremember him Price says turning to me Evelyn described him as the goodnatured body builder Thats how she introduced him I swear\\n   Oh shut up she says annoyed but she looks over at Timothy in the mirror and smiles flirtatiously\\n   I mean I doubt Stash makes the society pages ofW which I thought was your criterion for choosing friends Price says staring back grinning at her in his wolfish lewd way I concentrate on the Absolut and cranberry Im holding and it looks like a glassful of thin watery blood with ice and a lemon wedge in it\\n   Whats going on with Courtney and Luis I ask hoping to break

Timothy in retaliation smells Evelyns neck and says What is that fascinating odor\\n   Obsession Evelyn smiles flirtatiously gently pushing Timothy away Its Obsession Patrick get yourfriendaway fromme\\n   No no wait Timothy says sniffing loudly Its not ObsessionIts its and then with a face twisted in mock horror Its Oh my god itsQT Instatan\\n   Evelyn pauses and considers her options She inspects Prices head one more time Are you losing your hair\\n   Evelyn Tim says Dont change the subject but And then genuinely worried Now that you mention it too much gel Concerned he runs a hand over it\\n   Maybe Evelyn says Now make yourself useful and dosit down\\n   Well at least its not green and I havent tried to cut it with a butter knife Tim says referring to Vandens dye job and

 Your face definitely looks rounder Evelyn says Less chiseled\\n   I dont believe this Tim again\\n   He looks deep into the mirror She continues brushing her hair but the strokes are less definite

loudly Getoutof here\\n   You areorange He laughs on his knees his head in her lap You lookorange\\n   I amnot she says her voice a low prolonged growl of pain ecstasy Jerk\\n   I lie on the bed watching the two of them Timothy is in her lap trying to push his head under the Ralph Lauren robe Evelyns head is thrown back with pleasure and she is trying to push him away but playfully and hitting him only lightly on his back with her Jan Hov brush I am fairly sure that Timothy and Evelyn are having an affair Timothy is the only interesting person I know\\n   You should go she says finally panting She has stopped struggling with him\\n   He looks up at her flashing a toothy goodlooking smile and says Anything the lady requests\\n   Thank you she says in a voice that sounds to me tinged with disappointment\\n   He stands up Dinner Tomorrow\\n   Ill have to ask my boyfriend she says smiling at me in the mirror\\n   Will you wear that sexy black Anne Klein dress he asks his hands on her shoulders whispering this into her ear as he smells it Batemans not welcome\\n   I laugh goodnaturedly while getting up from the bed escorting him out of the room\\n   Wait My espresso he calls out\\n   Evelyn laughs then claps as if delighted by Timothys reluctance to vacate\\n   Come on fella I say as I push him roughly out of the bedroom Beddybye time\\n   He still manages to blow her a kiss before I get him out and away He is completely silent as I walk him out of the brownstone\\n   After he leaves I pour myself a brandy and drink it from a checkered Italian tumbler and when I come back to the bedroom I find Evelyn lying in bed watching the Home Shopping Club I lie down next to her and loosen my Armani tie Finally I ask something without looking at her\\n   Why dont you just go for Price\\n   Oh god Patrick she says her eyes shut Why PricePrice And she says this in a way that makes me think she has had sex with him\\n   Hes rich I say\\n   Everybodysrich she says concentrating on the TV screen\\n   Hes goodlooking I tell her\\n   Everybodysgoodlooking Patrick she says remotely\\n   He has a great body I say\\n   Everybodyhas a great body now she says\\n   I place the tumbler on the nightstand and roll over on top of her While I kiss and lick her neck she stares passionlessly at the widescreen Panasonic remotecontrol television set and lowers the volume I pull my Armani shirt up and place her hand on my torso wanting her to feel how rockhard howhalvedmy stomach is and I flex the muscles grateful its light in the room so she can see how bronzed and defined my abdomen has become\\n   You know she says clearly Stash tested positive for the AIDS virus And She pauses something on the screen catching her interest the volume goes slightly up and then is lowered And I think he will probably sleep with Vanden tonight\\n   Good I say biting lightly at her neck one of my hands on a firm cold breast\\n   Youre evil she says slightly excited running her hands along my broad hard shoulder\\n   No I sigh Just your fianc\\n   After attempting to have sex with her for around fifteen minutes I decide not to continue trying\\n   She says You know you can always be in better shape\\n   I reach for the tumbler of brandy I finish it Evelyn is addicted to Parnate an antidepressant I lie there beside her watching the Home Shopping Club at glass dolls embroidered throw pillows lamps shaped like footballs Lady Zirconia  with the sound turned off Evelyn starts drifting\\n   Are you using minoxidil she asks after a long time\\n   No Im not I say Why should I\\n   Your hairline looks like its receding she murmurs\\n   Its not I find myself saying Its hard to tell My hair is very thick and I cant tell if Im losing it I really doubt it\\n   I walk back to my place and say good night to a doorman I dont recognize he could be anybody and then dissolve into my living room high above the city the sounds of the Tokens singing The Lion Sleeps Tonight coming from the glow of the Wurlitzer  jukebox which is not as good as the hardtofind Wurlitzer  that stands in the comer of the living room I masturbate thinking about first Evelyn then Courtney then Vanden and then Evelyn again but right before I come a weak orgasm  about a nearnaked model in a halter top I saw today in a Calvin Klein advertisement\\n   Morning\\n   In the early light of a May dawn this is what the living room of my apartment looks like Over the white marble and granite gaslog fireplace hangs an original David Onica Its a sixfootbyfourfoot portrait of a naked woman mostly done in muted grays and olives sitting on a chaise longue watching MTV the backdrop a Martian landscape a gleaming mauve desert scattered with dead gutted fish smashed plates rising like a sunburst above the womans yellow head and the whole thing is framed in black aluminum steel The painting overlooks a long white downfilled sofa and a thirtyinch digital TV set from Toshiba its a highcontrast highly defined model plus it has a fourcorner video stand with a hightech tube combination from NEC with a pictureinpicture digital effects system plus freezeframe the audio includes builtin MTS and a fivewattperchannel onboard amp A Toshiba VCR sits in a glass case beneath the TV set its a superhighband Beta unit and has builtin editing function including a character generator with eightpage memory a highband record and playback and threeweek eightevent timer A hurricane halogen lamp is placed in each corner of the living room Thin white venetian blinds cover all eight floortoceiling windows A glasstop coffee table with oak legs by Turchin sits in front of the sofa with Steuben glass animals placed strategically around expensive crystal ashtrays from Fortunoff though I dont smoke Next to the Wurlitzer jukebox is a black ebony Baldwin concert grand piano A polished white oak floor runs throughout the apartment On the other side of the room next to a desk and a magazine rack by Gio Ponti is a complete stereo system CD player tape deck tuner amplifier by Sansui with sixfoot Duntech Sovereign  speakers in Brazilian rosewood A downfilled futon lies on an oakwood frame in the center of the bedroom Against the wall is a Panasonic thirtyoneinch set with a directview screen and stereo sound and beneath it in a glass case is a Toshiba VCR Im not sure if the time on the Sony digital alarm clock is correct so I have to sit up then look down at the time flashing on and off on the VCR then pick up the Ettore Sottsass pushbutton phone that rests on the steel and glass nightstand next to the bed and dial the time number A cream leather steel and wood chair designed by Eric Marcus is in one corner of the room a molded plywood chair in the other A blackdotted beige and white Maud Sienna carpet covers most of the floor One wall is hidden by four chests of immense bleached mahogany drawers In bed Im wearing Ralph Lauren silk pajamas and when I get up I slip on a paisley ancient madder robe and walk to the bathroom I urinate while trying to make out the puffiness of my reflection in the glass that encases a baseball poster hung above the toilet After I change into Ralph Lauren monogrammed boxer shorts and a Fair Isle sweater and slide into silk polkadot Enrico Hidolin slippers I tie a plastic ice pack around my face and commence with the mornings stretching exercises Afterwards I stand in front of a chrome and acrylic Washmobile bathroom sink with soap dish cup holder and railings that serve as towel bars which I bought at Hastings Tile to use while the marble sinks I ordered from Finland are being sanded  and stare at my reflection with the ice pack still on I pour some Plax antiplaque formula into a stainlesssteel tumbler and swish it around my mouth for thirty seconds Then I squeeze Rembrandt onto a fauxtortoiseshell toothbrush and start brushing my teeth too hung over to floss properly  but maybe I flossed before bed last night and rinse with Listerine Then I inspect my hands and use a nailbrush I take the icepack mask off and use a deeppore cleanser lotion then an herbmint facial masque which I leave on for ten minutes while I check my toenails Then I use the Probright tooth polisher and next the Interplak tooth polisher this in addition to the toothbrush which has a speed of  rpm and reverses direction fortysix times per second the larger tufts clean between teeth and massage the gums while the short ones scrub the tooth surfaces I rinse again with Cepacol I wash the facial massage off with a spearmint face scrub The shower has a universal alldirectional shower head that adjusts within a thirtyinch vertical range Its made from Australian goldblack brass and covered with a white enamel finish In the shower I use first a wateractivated gel cleanser then a honeyalmond body scrub and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub Vidal Sassoon shampoo is especially good at getting rid of the coating of dried perspiration salts oils airborne pollutants and dirt that can weigh down hair and flatten it to the scalp which can make you look older The conditioner is also good  silicone technology permits conditioning benefits without weighing down the hair which can also make you look older On weekends or before a date I prefer to use the Greune Natural Revitalizing Shampoo the conditioner and the Nutrient Complex These are formulas that contain Dpanthenol a vitaminBcomplex factor polysorbate  a cleansing agent for the scalp and natural herbs Over the weekend I plan to go to Bloomingdales or Bergdorfs and on Evelyns advice pick up a Foltene European Supplement and Shampoo for thinning hair which contains complex carbohydrates that penetrate the hair shafts for improved strength and shine Also the Vivagen Hair Enrichment Treatment a newRedken product that prevents mineral deposits and prolongs the life cycle of hair Luis Carruthers recommended the Aramis Nutriplexx system a nutrient complex that helps increase circulation Once out of the shower and toweled dry I put the Ralph Lauren boxers back on and before applying the Mousse A Raiser a shaving cream by Pour Hommes I press a hot towel against my face for two minutes to soften abrasive beard hair Then I always slather on a moisturizer to my taste Clinique and let it soak in for a minute You can rinse it off or keep it on and apply a shaving cream over it  preferably with a brush which softens the beard as it lifts the whiskers  which Ive found makes removing the hair easier It also helps prevent water from evaporating and reduces friction between your skin and the blade Always wet the razor with warm water before shaving and shave in the directionthe beard grows pressing gently on the skin Leave the sideburns and chin for last since these whiskers are tougher and need more time to soften Rinse the razor and shake off any excess water before starting Afterwards splash cool water on the face to remove any trace of lather You should use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol Never use cologne on your face since the high alcohol content dries your face out and makes you look older One should use an alcoholfree antibacterial toner with a watermoistened cotton ball to normalize the skin Applying a moisturizer is the final step Splash on water before applying an emollient lotion to soften the skin and seal in the moisture Next apply Gel Appaisant also made by Pour Hommes which is an excellent soothing skin lotion If the face seems dry and flaky  which makes it look dull and older  use a clarifying lotionthat removes flakes and uncovers fine skin it can also make your tan look darker Then apply an antiaging eye balm Baume Des Yeux followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion A scalpprogramming lotion is used after I towel my hair dry I also lightly blowdry the hair to give it bodyand control but without stickiness and then add more of the lotion shaping it with a Kent naturalbristle brush and finally slick it back with a widetooth comb I pull the Fair Isle sweater back on and reslip my feet into the polkadot silk slippers then head into the living room and put the new Talking Heads in the CD player but it starts to digitally skip so I take it out and put in a CD laser lens cleaner The laser lens is very sensitive and subject to interference from dust or dirt or smoke or pollutants or moisture and a dirty one can inaccurately read CDs making for false starts inaudible passages digital skipping speed changes and general distortion the lens cleaner has a cleaning brush that automatically aligns with the lens then the disk spins to remove residue and particles When I put the Talking Heads CD back in it plays smoothly I retrieve the copy ofUSA Todaythat lies in front of my door in the hallway and bring it with me into the kitchen where I take two Advil a multivitamin and a potassium tablet washing them down with a large bottle of Evian water since the maid an elderly Chinese woman forgot to turn the dishwasher on when she left yesterday and then I have to pour the grapefruitlemon juice into a St Rmy wineglass I got from Baccarat I check the neon clock that hangs over the refrigerator to make sure I have enough time to eat breakfast unhurriedly Standing at the island in the kitchen I eat kiwifruit and a sliced Japanese applepear they cost four dollars each at Gristedes out of aluminum storage boxes that were designed in West Germany I take a bran muffin a decaffeinated herbal tea bag and a box of oatbran cereal from one of the large glassfront cabinets that make up most of an entire wall in the kitchen complete with stainlesssteel shelves and sandblasted wire glass it isframed in a metallic dark grayblue I eat half of the bran muffin after its been microwaved and lightly covered with a small helping of apple butter A bowl of oatbran cereal with wheat germ and soy milk follows another bottle of Evian water and a small cup of decaf tea after that Next to the Panasonic bread baker and the Salton PopUp coffee maker is the Cremina sterling silver espresso maker which is oddly still warm that I got at Hammacher Schlemmer the thermalinsulated stainlesssteel espresso cup and the saucer and spoon are sitting by the sink stained and the Sharp Model RA Carousel II microwave oven with revolving turntable which I use when I heat up the other half of the bran muffin Next to the Salton Sonata toaster and the Cuisinart Little Pro food processor and the Acme Supreme Juicerator and the Cordially Yours liqueur maker stands the heavygauge stainlesssteel twoandonehalfquart teakettle which whistles Tea for Two when the water is boiling and with it I make another small cup of the decaffeinated applecinnamon tea For what seems like a long time I stare at the Black Decker Handy Knife that lies on the counter next to the sink plugged into the wall its a sliverpeeler with several attachments a serrated blade a scalloped blade and a rechargeable handle The suit I wear today is from Alan Flusser Its an eighties drape suit which is an updated version of the thirties style The favored version has extended natural shoulders a full chest and a bladed back The softrolled lapels should be about four inches wide with the peak finishing three quarters of the way across the shoulders Properly used on doublebreasted suits peaked lapels are considered more elegant than notched ones Lowslung pockets have a flapped doublebesom design above the flap theres a slit trimmed on either side with a flat narrow strip of cloth Four buttons form a lowslung square above it about where the lapels cross there are two more buttons The trousers are deeply pleated and cut full in order to continue the flow of the wide jacket An extended waist is cut slightly higher in the front Tabs make the suspenders fit well at the center back The tie is a dotted silk design by Valentino Couture The shoes are crocodile loafers by A Testoni While Im dressing the TV is kept on toThe Patty Winters ShowTodays guests are women with multiple personalities A nondescript overweight older woman is on the screen and Pattys voice is heard asking Well is it schizophrenia or whats the dealTell us\\n   No oh no Multiple personalities arenotschizophrenics the woman says shaking her head We arenotdangerous\\n   Well Patty starts standing in the middle of the audience microphone in hand Who were you last month\\n   Last month it seemed to be mostly Polly the woman says\\n   A cut to the audience a housewifes worried face before she notices herself on the monitor it cuts back to the multiplepersonality woman\\n   Well Patty continues nowwho are you\\n   Well the woman begins tiredly as if she was sick of being asked this question as if she had answered it over and over again and still no one believed it Well this month Im Lambchop Mostly Lambchop\\n   A long pause The camera cuts to a closeup of a stunned housewife shaking her head another housewife whispering something to her\\n   The shoes Im wearing are crocodile loafers by A Testoni\\n   Grabbing my raincoat out of the closet in the entranceway I find a Burberry scarf and matching coat with a whale embroidered on it something a little kid might wear and its covered with what looks like dried chocolate syrup crisscrossed over the front darkening the lapels I take the elevator downstairs to the lobby rewinding my Rolex by gently shaking my wrist I say good morning to the doorman step outside and hail a cab heading downtown toward Wall Street\\n   Harrys\\n   Price and I walk down Hanover Street in the darkest moments of twilight and as if guided by radar move silently toward Harrys Timothy hasnt said anything since we left P P He doesnt even comment on the ugly bum that crouches beneath a Dumpster off Stone Street though he does manage a grim wolf whistle toward a woman big tits blonde great ass high heels  heading toward Water Street Price seems nervous and edgy and I have no desire to ask him whats wrong Hes wearing a linen suit by Canali Milano a cotton shirt by Ike Behar a silk tie by Bill Blass and captoed leather laceups from Brooks Brothers Im wearing a lightweight linen suit with pleated trousers a cotton shirt a dotted silk tie all by Valentino Couture and perforated captoe leather shoes by AllenEdmonds Once inside Harrys we spot David Van Patten and Craig McDermott at a table up front Van Patten is wearing a doublebreasted wool and silk sport coat buttonfly wool and silk trousers with inverted pleats by Mario Valentino a cotton shirt by Gitman Brothers a polkadot silk tie by Bill Blass and leather shoes from Brooks Brothers McDermott is wearing a wovenlinen suit with pleated trousers a buttondown cotton and linen shirt by Basile a silk tie by Joseph Abboud and ostrich loafers from Susan Bennis Warren Edwards\\n   The two are hunched over the table writing on the backs of paper napkins a Scotch and a martini placed respectively in front of them They wave us over Price throws his Tumi leather attach case on an empty chair and heads toward the bar I call out to him for a JB on the rocks then sit down with Van Patten and McDermott\\n   Hey Bateman Craig says in a voice that suggests this is not his first martini Is it proper to wear tasseled loafers with a business suit or not Dont look at me like Im insane\\n   Oh shitdontask Bateman Van Patten moans waving a gold Cross pen in front of his face absently sipping from the martini glass\\n   Van Patten Craig says\\n   Yeah\\n   McDermott hesitates then says Shut up in a flat voice\\n   What are you screwballs up to I spot Luis Carruthers standing at the bar next to Price who ignores him utterly Carruthers is not dressed well a fourbutton doublebreasted wool suit I think by Chaps a striped cotton shirt and a silk bow tie plus hornrimmed eyeglasses by Oliver Peoples\\n   Bateman were sending these questions in toGQ Van Patten begins\\n   Luis spots me smiles weakly then if Im not mistaken blushes and turns back to the bar Bartenders always ignore Luis for some reason\\n   We have this bet to see which one of us will get in the Question and Answer column first and so now I expect an answerWhat do you think McDermott demands\\n   Aboutwhat I ask irritably\\n   Tasseled loafers jerkoff he says\\n   Well guys I measure my words carefully The tasseled loafer is traditionally a casual shoe I glance back at Price wanting the drink badly He brushes past Luis who offers his hand Price smiles says something moves on strides over to our table Luis once more tries to catch the bartenders attention and once more fails\\n   But its become acceptable just because its so popular right Craig asks eagerly\\n   Yeah I nod As long as its either black or cordovan its okay\\n   What about brown Van Patten asks suspiciously\\n   I think about this then say Too sporty for a business suit\\n   What are you fags talking about Price asks He hands me the drink then sits down crossing his legs\\n   Okay okay okay Van Patten says This ismy question A twoparter He pauses dramatically Now are rounded collars too dressy or too casual Part two which tie knot looks best with them\\n   A distracted Price his voice still tense answers quickly with an exact clear enunciation that can be heard over the din in Harrys Its a very versatile look and it can go with both suitsandsport coats It should be starched for dressy occasions and a collar pin should be worn if its particularly formal He pauses sighs it looks as if hes spotted somebody I turn around to see who it is Price continues If its worn with a blazer then the collar should look soft and it can be worn either pinned or unpinned Since its a traditional preppy look its best if balanced by a relatively small fourinhand knot He sips his martini recrossing his legs Next question\\n   Buy the man a drink McDermott says obviously impressed\\n   Price Van Patten says\\n   Yes Price says casing the room\\n   Youre priceless\\n   Listen I ask where are we having dinner\\n   I brought the trusty Mr Zagat Van Patten says pulling the long crimson booklet out of his pocket and

 Price taps me on the shoulder What doesthat mean\\n   Anyway listen McDermott says She would are you ready He pauses dramatically She would only give me a hand job and get this she kept hergloveon He sits back in his chair and sips his drink in a smug satisfied sort of way\\n   We all take this in solemnly No one makes fun of McDermotts revelatory statement or of his inability to react more aggressively with this chick No one says anything but we are all thinking the same thoughtNeverpick up a Vassar girl\\n   What you need is a chick fromCamden Van Patten says after recovering from

wake up and well do it again but youve got to keep one hand on my cock and the other on my balls and she says okay but why do I have to keep one hand on your dick and one one hand on your balls and He notices that Van Patten is idly doodling something on the back of a napkin Hey Van Patten  are you listening to me\\n   Imlistening Van Patten says irritated Go ahead Finish it One hand on my cock one hand on my balls go on\\n   Luis Carruthers is still standing at the bar waiting for a drink Now it looks to me like his silk bow tie is by Agnes B Its all unclear\\n   Im not Price says\\n   And he says because   Again Preston falters Theres a long silence Preston looks at me\\n   Dont look atme I say Its notmyjoke\\n   And he says My minds a blank\\n   Is that the punch line My minds a blank McDermott asks\\n   He says um because Preston puts a hand over his eyes and thinks about it Oh gosh I cant believe I forgot this\\n   Ohgreat Preston Price sighs You are one unfunny bastard\\n   My minds a blank Craig asks me I dont get it\\n   Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah Preston says Listen I remember Because the last time I fucked a nigger she stole my wallet He starts chuckling immediately And after a short moment of silence the table cracks up too except for me\\n   Thats it thats the punch line Preston says proudly relieved\\n   Van Patten gives him highfive Even Price laughs\\n   Oh Christ I say Thats awful\\n   Why won says Its funny Itshumor\\n   Yeah Bateman McDermott says Cheer up\\n   Oh I forgot Batemans dating someone from the ACLU Price says What bothers you about that\\n   Its not funny I say Itsracist\\n   Bateman you are some kind of morose bastard Preston says You should stop reading all those Ted Bundy biographies Preston stands up and checks his Rolex Listen men Im off Will see you tomorrow\\n   Yeah Same Bat Time same Bat Channel Van Patten says nudging me\\n   Preston leans forward before leaving Because the last time I fucked a nigger she stole my wallet\\n   I get it I get it I say pushing him away\\n   Remember this guys Few things perform in life as well as a Kenwood He exits\\n   Yabbadabbado Van Patten says\\n   Hey did anyone know cavemen got more fiber than we get McDermott asks\\n   Pastels\\n   Im on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Pastels since Im positive we wont get seated but the table is good and relief that is almost tidal in scope washes over me in an awesome wave At Pastels McDermott knows the matre d and though we made our reservations from a cab only minutes ago were immediately led past the overcrowded bar into the pink brightly lit main dining room and seated at an excellent booth for four up front Its really impossible to get a reservation at Pastels and I think Van Patter myself even Price are impressed by maybe even envious of McDermotts prowess in securing a table After we piled into a cab on Water Street we realized that no one had made reservations anywhere and while debating the merits of a new CalifornianSicilian bistro on the Upper East Side  my panic so great I almost ripped Zagat in two  the consensus seemed to emerge Price had the only dissenting voice but he finally shrugged and said I dont give a shit and we used his portaphone to make the reservation He slipped his Walkman on and turned the volume up so loud that the sound of Vivaldi was audible even with the windows halfway open and the noise of the uptown traffic blasting into the taxi Van Patter and McDermott made rude jokes about the size of Tims dick and I did too Outside Pastels Tim grabbed the napkin with Van Patters final version of his carefully phrased questionforGQon it and tossed it at a bum huddling outside the restaurant feebly holding up a sloppy cardboard sign I AM HUNGRY AND HOMELESS PLEASE HELP ME\\n   Things seem to be going smoothly The matre d has sent over four complimentary Bellinis but we order drinks anyway The Ronettes are singing Then He Kissed Me our waitress is a little hardbody and even Price seems relaxed though he hates the place Plus there are four women at the table opposite ours all greatlooking  blond big tits one is wearing a chemise dress in doublefaced wool by Calvin Klein another is wearing a wool knit dress and jacket with silk faille bonding by Geoffrey Beene another is wearing a symmetrical skirt of pleated tulle and an embroidered velvet bustier by I think Christian Lacroix plus highheeled shoes by Sidonie Larizzi and the last one is wearing a black strapless sequined gown under a wool crepe tailored jacket by Bill Blass Now the Shirelles are coming out of the speakers Dancing in the Street and the sound system plus the acoustics because of the restaurants high ceiling are so loud that we have to practically scream out our order to the hardbody waitress  who is wearing a bicolored suit of wool grain with passementerie trim by Myrone de Prmonville and velvet ankle boots and who Im fairly sure is flirting with me laughs sexily when I order as an appetizer the monkfish and squid ceviche with golden caviar gives me a stare so steamy so penetrating when I order the gravlax potpie with green tomatillo sauce I have to look back at the pink Bellini in the tall champagne flute with a concerneddeadlyserious expression so as not to let her think Imtoointerested Price orders the tapas and then the venison with yogurt sauce and fiddlehead ferns with mango slices McDermott orders the sashimi with goat cheese and then the smoked duck with endive and maple syrup Van Patten has the scallop sausage and the grilled salmon with raspberry vinegar and guacamole The airconditioning in the restaurant is on full blast and Im beginning to feel bad that Im not wearing the new Versace pullover I bought last week at Bergdorfs It would look good with the suit Im wearing\\n   Could you please get rid of these things Price tells the busboy as he gestures toward the Bellinis\\n   Wait Tim Van Patten says Coolout Illdrink them\\n   Eurotrash David Price explains Eurotrash\\n   You can havemine Van Patten I say\\n   Wait McDermott says holding the busboy back Im keeping mine too\\n   Why Price asks Are you trying to entice that Armenian chick over by the bar\\n   What Armenian chick Van Patten is suddenly craning his neck interested\\n   Just take them all Price says practically seething\\n   The busboy humbly removes the glasses nodding to no one as he walks away\\n   Who madeyouboss McDermott whines\\n   Look guys Look who just came in Van Patten whistles Oh boy\\n   Oh for Christ sakesnotfucking Preston Price sighs\\n   No Oh no Van Patten says ominously He hasnt spotted us yet\\n   Victor Powell Paul Owen I say suddenly scared\\n   Hes twentyfour and worth oh lets say arepulsive amount of dough Van Patten hints grinning He has obviously been spotted by the person and flashes a bright toothy smile A veritableshitload\\n   I crane my neck but cant figure out whos doing anything\\n   Its Scott Montgomery Price says Isnt it Its Scott Montgomery\\n   Perhaps Van Patten teases\\n   Its that dwarf Scott Montgomery says Price\\n   Price Van Patten says Youre priceless\\n   Watch me act thrilled Price says turning around Well as thrilled as I can get meeting someone from Georgia\\n   Whoa McDermott says And hes dressed to impress\\n   Hey Price says Im depressed I mean impressed\\n   Wow I say spotting Montgomery Elegant navies\\n   Subtle plaids Van Patten whispers\\n   Lotsa beige Price says Youknow\\n   Here he comes I say bracing myself\\n   Scott Montgomery walks over to our booth wearing a doublebreasted navy blue blazer with mocktortoiseshell buttons a prewashed wrinkledcotton striped dress shirt with red accent stitching a red white and blue fireworksprint silk tie by Hugo Boss and plum washedwool trousers with a quadruplepleated front and slashed pockets by Lazo Hes holding a glass of champagne and hands it to the girl hes with definite model type thin okay tits no ass high

Edwards Sunglasses by Alain Mikli Pressedleather bag from Herms\\n   Hey fellas How yall doin Montgomery speaks in a thick Georgia twang This is Nicki Nicki this is McDonald Van Buren Bateman nice tan  and Mr Price He shakes only Timothys hand and then takes the champagne glass from Nicki Nicki smiles politely like a robot probably doesnt speak English\\n   Montgomery Price says in a kindly conversational tone staring at Nicki How have things been\\n   Well fellas Montgomery says See yall got the primo table Get the check yet Just kidding\\n   Listen Montgomery Price says staring at Nicki but still being unusually kind to someone I thought was a stranger Squash\\n   Call me Montgomery says absently looking over the room Is that Tyson Heres my card\\n   Great Price says pocketing it Thursday\\n   Cant Going to Dallas tomorrow but Montgomery is already moving away from the table hurrying toward someone else snapping for Nicki Yeah next week\\n   Nicki smiles at me then looks at the floor pink blue lime green tiles crisscrossing each other in triangular patterns  as if it had some kind of answer held some sort of clue offered a coherent reason as to why she was stuck with Montgomery Idly I wonder if shes older than him and then if shes flirting with me\\n   Later Price is saying\\n   Later fellas Montgomery is already about halfway across the room Nicki slinks behind him I was wrong shedoeshave an ass\\n   Eight hundred million McDermott whistles shaking his head\\n   College I ask\\n   A joke Price hints\\n   Rollins I guess\\n   Get this McDermott says HampdenSydney\\n   Hes a parasite a loser a weasel Van Patten concludes\\n   But hes worth eight hundredmillion McDermott repeats emphatically\\n   Go over and give the dwarfheadwill that shut youup Price says I mean how impressed can yougetMcDermott\\n   Anyway I mention nice babe\\n   That girlishot McDermott agrees\\n   Affirmative Price nods but grudgingly\\n   Oh man Van Patten says distressed Iknowthat chick\\n   Oh bullshit we all moan\\n   Let me guess I say Picked her up at Tunnel right\\n   No he says then after sipping his drink Shes a model Anorexic alcoholic uptight bitchTotallyFrench\\n   What a joke you are I say unsure if hes lying\\n   Wanna bet\\n   So what McDermott shrugs Id fuck her\\n   She drinks a liter of Stoli a day then throws it up andredrinks it McDermott Van Patten explains Total alkie\\n   Totalcheapalkie Price murmurs\\n   I dont care McDermott says bravely She is beautiful I want to fuck her I want to marry her I want her to have my children\\n   Oh Jesus Van Patten says practically gagging Who wants to marry a chick whos gonna give birth to a jug of vodka and cranberry juice\\n   Hehasa point I say\\n   Yeah He also wants to shack up with the Armenian chick at the bar Price sneers Whatll she give birth to a bottle of Korbel and a pint of peach juice\\n   WhatArmenian chick McDermott asks exasperated craning his neck\\n   Oh Jesus Fuck off you faggots Van Patten sighs\\n   The matre d stops by to say hello to McDermott then notices we dont have our complimentary Bellinis and runs off before any of us can stop him Im not sure how McDermott knows Alain so well  maybe Cecelia  and it slightly pisses me off but I decide to even up the score a little bit by showing everyone my new business card I pull it out of my gazelleskin wallet Barneys  and slap it on the table waiting for reactions\\n   Whats that a gram Price says not apathetically\\n   New card I try to act casual about it but Im smiling proudly What do you think\\n   Whoa McDermott says lifting it up fingering the card genuinely impressed Very nice Take a look He hands it to Van Patten\\n   Picked them up from the printers yesterday I mention\\n   Cool coloring Van Patten says studying the card closely\\n   Thats bone I point out And the lettering is something called Silian Rail\\n   Silian Rail McDermott asks\\n   Yeah Not bad huh\\n   Itisvery cool Bateman Van Patten says guardedly the jealous bastard but thats nothing  He pulls out his wallet and slaps a card next to an ashtray Look at this\\n   We all lean over and inspect Davids card and Price quietly says Thatsreally nice A brief spasm of jealousy courses through me when I notice the elegance of the color and the classy type I clench my fist as Van Patten says smugly Eggshell with Romalian type He turns to me What do you think\\n   Nice I croak but manage to nod as the busboy brings four fresh Bellinis\\n   Jesus Price says holding the card up to the light ignoring the new drinks This is really super Howd a nitwit like you get so tasteful\\n   Im looking at Van Pattens card and then at mine and cannot believe that Price actually likes Van Pattens better\\n   Dizzy I sip my drink then take a deep breath\\n   But wait Price says You aint seen nothin yet He pulls his out of an inside coat pocket and slowly dramatically turns it over for our inspection and says Mine\\n   Even I have to admit its magnificent\\n   Suddenly the restaurant seems far away hushed the noise distant a meaningless hum compared to this card and we all hear Prices words Raised lettering pale nimbus white\\n   Holy shit Van Patten exclaims Ive never seen\\n   Nice very nice I have to admit But wait Lets see Montgomerys\\n   Price pulls it out and though hes acting nonchalant I dont see how he can ignore its subtle offwhite coloring its tasteful thickness I am unexpectedly depressed that I started this\\n   Pizza Lets order a pizza McDermott says Doesnt anyone want to split a pizza Red snapper Mmmmm Bateman wantsthat he says rubbing his hands eagerly together\\n   I pick up Montgomerys card and actually finger it for the sensation the card gives off to the pads of my fingers\\n   Nice huh Prices tone suggests he realizes Im jealous\\n   Yeah I say offhandedly giving Price the card like I dont give a shit but Im finding it hard to swallow\\n   Red snapper pizza McDermott reminds me Im fucking starving\\n   No pizza I murmur relieved when Montgomerys card is placed away out of sight back in Timothys pocket\\n   Come on McDermott says whining Lets order the red upper pizza\\n   Shut up Craig Van Patten says eyeing a waitress taking a booths order But call that hardbody over\\n   But shes not ours McDermott says fidgeting with the menu hes yanked from a passing busboy\\n   Call her overanyway Van Patten insists Ask her for water or a Corona or something\\n   Whyher Im asking no one in particular My card lies on the table ignored next to an orchid in a blue glass vase Gently I pick it up and slip it folded back into my wallet\\n   She looks exactly like this girl who works in the Georgette Klinger section of Bloomingdales Van Patten says Call her over\\n   Does anyone want the pizza or not McDermotts getting testy\\n   How wouldyouknow I ask Van Patten\\n   I buy Kates perfumethere he answers\\n   Prices gestures gather the tables attention Did I forget to tell everyone that Montgomerys a dwarf\\n   Whos Kate I say\\n   Kateis the chick who Van Patters having the affair with Price explains staring back at Montgomerys table\\n   What happened to MissKittridge I ask\\n   Yeah Price smiles WhataboutAmanda\\n   Oh god guyslighten up FidelityRight\\n   Arent you afraid of diseases Price asks\\n   Fromwho Amanda or Kate I ask\\n   I thought we agreed thatwe cant get it Van Pattens voice rises Soooo shithead Shut up\\n   Didnt I tell you\\n   Four more Bellinis arrive There are now eight Bellinis on the table\\n   Oh my god Price moans trying to grab at the busboy before he scampers off\\n   Red snapper pizza red snapper pizza McDermott has found a mantra for the evening\\n   Well soon become targets for horny Iranian chicks Price drones\\n   Its like zero zero zero percentage whatever you know are you listening Van Patten asks\\n   snapper pizza red snapper pizza Then McDermott slams his hand on the table rocking it Goddamnit isnt anybody listening to me\\n   Im still tranced out on Montgomerys card the classy coloring the thickness the lettering the print  and I suddenly raise a fist as if to strike out at Craig and scream my voice booming No one wants the fuckingred snapper pizza A pizza should beyeastyand slightlybreadyand have acheesy crust The crusts here are too fucking thin because the shithead chef who cooks here overbakes everything The pizza is dried out and brittle Redfaced I slam my Bellini down on the table and when I look up our appetizers have arrived A hardbody waitress stands looking down at me with this strange glazed expression I wipe a hand over my face genially smiling up at her She stands there looking at me as if I were some kind of monster she actually looksscared and I glance over at Price  for what guidance  and he mouths Cigars and pats his coat pocket\\n   McDermott quietly says I dont think theyre brittle\\n   Honey I say ignoring McDermott taking an arm and pulling her toward me She flinches but I smile and she lets me pull her closer Now were all going to eat a nice big meal here I start to explain\\n   But this isnt what I ordered Van Patten says looking at his plate I wanted themusselsausage\\n   Shut up I shoot him a glance then calmly turn toward the hardbody grinning like an idiot but a handsome idiot Now listen we are good customers here and were probably going to order some fine brandy cognac who knows and we want to relax and bask in this I gesture with my arm  atmosphere Now  with the other hand I pull out my gazelleskin wallet  we would like to enjoy somefineCuban cigars afterwards and we dont want to be bothered by someloutish\\n   Loutish McDermott nods to Van Patten and Price\\n   Loutish and inconsiderate patrons or tourists who are inevitably going to complain about our innocuous little habit So  I press what I hope is fifty into a smallboned hand  if you could make sure we arent bothered while we do we wouldgratefully appreciate it I rub the hand closing it into a fist over the bill And if anyone complains well I pause then warn menacingly Kick em out\\n   She nods mutely and backs away with this dazed confused look on her face\\n   And Price adds smiling if another round of Bellinis comes within a twentyfoot radius of this table we are going to set the matre d on fire So you know warn him\\n   After a long silence during which we contemplate our appetizers Van Patten speaks up Bateman\\n   Yes I fork a piece of monkfish push it into some of the golden caviar then place the fork back down\\n   You are pure prep perfection he purrs\\n   Price spots another waitress approaching with a tray of four champagne flutes filled with pale pinkish liquid and says Oh for Christ sakes this is gettingridiculous She sets them down however at the table next to us for the four babes\\n   She ishot  Van Patten says ignoring his scallop sausage\\n   Hardbody McDermott nods in agreement Definitely\\n   Im not impressed Price sniffs Look at her knees\\n   While the hardbody stands there we check her out and though her knees do support long tan legs I cant help noticing that one knee is admittedly bigger than the other one The left knee is knobbier almost imperceptibly thicker than the right knee and this unnoticeable flaw now seems overwhelming and we all lose interest Van Patten is looking at his appetizer stunned and then he looks at McDermott and says That isnt what you ordered either Thatssushinot sashimi\\n   Jesus McDermott sighs You dont come here for the food anyway\\n   Some guy who looks exactly like Christopher Lauder comes over to the table and says patting me on the shoulder Hey Hamilton nice tan before walking into the mens room\\n   Nice tan Hamilton Price mimics tossing tapas onto my bread plate\\n   Oh gosh I say hope Im not blushin\\n   Actually wheredoyou go Bateman Van Patten asks For a tan\\n   Yeah Bateman Wheredoyou go McDermott seems genuinely intrigued\\n   Read my lips I say a tanning salon then irritably likeeveryoneelse\\n   I have Van Patten says pausing for maximum impact a tanning bed at home and then he takes a large bite out of his scallop sausage\\n   Oh bullshit I say cringing\\n   Itstrue McDermott confirms his mouth full Ive seen it\\n   That isfucking outrageous I say\\n   Why the hell is itfucking outrageous Price asks pushing tapas around his plate with a fork\\n   Do you know how expensive a fucking tanning salon membershipis Van Patten asks me Amembership for ayear\\n   Youre crazy I mutter\\n   Look guys Van Patten says Batemans indignant\\n   Suddenly a busboy appears at our table and without asking if were finished removes our mostly uneaten appetizers None of us complain except for McDermott who asks Did he just take our appetizers away and then laughs uncomprehendingly But when he sees no one else laughing he stops\\n   He took them away because the portions are so small he probably thought we were finished Price says tiredly\\n   I just think thats crazy about the tanning bed I tell Van Patten though secretly I think it would be a hip luxury except I really have no room for one in my apartment There are things one could do with it besides getting a tan\\n   Who is Paul Owen with I hear McDermott asking Price\\n   Some weasel from Kicker Peabody Price says distractedly He knew McCoy\\n   Then why is he sitting with those dweebs from Drexel McDermott asks Isnt that Spencer Wynn\\n   Are you freebasing orwhat Price asks Thats not Spencer Wynn\\n   I look over at Paul Owen sitting in a booth with three other guys one of whom could be Jeff Duvall suspenders slickedback hair hornrimmed glasses all of them drinking champagne  and I lazily wonder about how Owen got the Fisher account It makes me not hungry but our meals arrive almost immediately after our appetizers are taken away and we begin to eat McDermott undoes his suspenders Price calls him a slob I feel paralyzed but manage to turn away from Owen and stare at my plate the potpie a yellow hexagon strips of smoked salmon circling it squiggles of peagreen tomatillo sauce artfully surrounding the dish and then I gaze at the waiting crowd They seem hostile drunk on complimentary Bellinis perhaps tired of waiting hours for shitty tables near the open kitchen even though they had reservations Van Patten interrupts the silence at our table by slamming his fork down and pushing his chair back\\n   Whats wrong I say looking up from my plate a fork poised over it but my hand will not move its as if it appreciated the plates setup too much as if my hand had a mind of its own and refused to break up its design I sigh and put the fork down hopeless\\n   Shit I have to tape this movie on cable forMandy He wipes his mouth with a napkin stands up Ill be back\\n   Haveher do it idiot Price says What are you demented\\n   Shes in Boston seeing herdentist Van Patten shrugs pussywhipped\\n   What in the hell are you going to do My voice wavers Im still thinking about Van Pattens card Call up HBO\\n   No he says I have a touchtone phone hooked up to program a Videonics VCR programmer I bought at Hammacher Schlemmer He walks away pulling his suspenders up\\n   How hip I say tonelessly\\n   Hey what do you want for dessert McDermott calls out\\n   Something chocolate and flourless he shouts back\\n   Has Van Patten stopped working out I ask He looks puffy\\n   It looks that way doesnt it Price says\\n   Doesnt he have a membership at the Vertical Club I ask\\n   I dont know Price murmurs studying his plate then sitting up he pushes it away and motions to the waitress for another Finlandia on the rocks\\n   Another hardbody waitress approaches us tentatively bringing over a bottle of champagne PerrierJout nonvintage and tells us its complimentary from Scott Montgomery\\n   Nonvintage that weasel Price hisses craning his neck to find Montgomerys table Loser He gives him a thumbsup sign from across the room The fuckers so short I could barely see him I think I gave thumbsup to Conrad I cant be sure\\n   Wheres Conrad I ask I should say hello to him\\n   The dude who called you Hamilton Price says\\n   That wasnt Conrad I say\\n   Are you sure It looked a helluva lot like him he says but hes not really listening he blatantly stares at the hardbody waitress at exposed cleavage as she leans down to get a firmer grip on the bottles cork\\n   No That wasntConrad I say surprised at Prices inability to recognize coworkers That guy had a better haircut\\n   We sit in silence while the hardbody pours the champagne Once she leaves McDermott asks if we liked the food I tell him the potpie was fine but there was way too much tomatillo sauce McDermott nods says Thats what Ive heard\\n   Van Patten returns mumbling They dont have a good bathroom to do coke in\\n   Dessert McDermott suggests\\n   Only if I can order the Bellini sorbet Price says yawning\\n   How about just the check Van Patten says\\n   Time to go birddogging gentlemen I say\\n   The hardbody brings the check over The total is  much less than we expected We split it but I need the cash so I put it on my platinum AmEx and collect their bills mostly fresh fifties McDermott demands ten dollars back since his scallop sausage appetizer was only sixteen bucks Montgomerys bottle of champagne is left at the table undrunk Outside Pastels a different bum sits in the street with a sign that says something completely illegible He gently asks us for some change and then more hopefully for some food\\n   That dude needs a facialrealbad I say\\n   Hey McDermott Price cackles Throw him your tie\\n   Oh shit Whatsthatgonna get him I ask staring at the bum\\n   Appetizers at Jams Van Patten laughs He gives me highfive\\n   Dude McDermott says inspecting his tie clearly offended\\n   Oh sorry cab Price says waving down a cab anda beverage\\n   Off to Tunnel McDermott tells the driver\\n   Great McDermott Price says getting in the front seat You sound really excited\\n   So what if Im not some burnedout decadent faggot like yourself McDermott says getting in ahead of me\\n   Did anyone know cavemen got more fiber than we do Price asks the cabdriver\\n   HeyI heard that too McDermott says\\n   Van Patten I say Did you see the comp bottle of champagne Montgomery sent over\\n   Really Van Patten asks leaning over McDermott Let me guess PerrierJout\\n   Bingo Price says Nonvintage\\n   Fucking weasel Van Patten says\\n   Tunnel\\n   All of the men outside Tunnel tonight are for some reason wearing tuxedos except for a middleaged homeless bum who sits by a Dumpster only a few feet away from the ropes holding out to anyone who pays attention a Styrofoam coffee cup begging for change and as Price leads us around the crowd up to the ropes motioning to one of the doormen Van Patten waves a crisp onedollar bill in front of the homeless bums face which momentarily lights up then Van Patten pockets it as were whisked into the club handed a dozen drink tickets and two VIP Basement passes Once inside were vaguely hassled by two more doormen long wool coats ponytails probably German  who demand to know why were not wearing tuxedos Price handles this all suavely somehow either by tipping the dorks or by persuading them with his clout probably the former I stay uninvolved and with my back to him try to listen as McDermottcomplains to Van Patten about how crazy I am for putting down the pizzas made at Pastels but its hard to hear anything with Belinda Carlisles version of I Feel Free blasting over the sound system I have a knife with a serrated blade in the pocket of my Valentino jacket and Im tempted to gut McDermott with it right here in the entranceway maybe slice his face open sever his spine but Price finally waves us in and the temptation to kill McDermott is replaced by this strange anticipation to have a good time drink some champagne flirt with a hardbody find some blow maybe even dance to some oldies or that new Janet Jackson song I like\\n   It gets quieter as we move into the front hallway heading toward the actual entrance and we pass by three hardbodies One is wearing a black sidebuttoned notchedcollar wool jacket woolcrepe trousers and a fitted cashmere turtleneck all by Oscar de la Renta another is wearing a doublebreasted coat of wool mohair and nylon tweed matching jeansstyle pants and a mans cotton dress shirt all by Stephen Sprouse the bestlooking one is wearing a checked wool jacket and highwaisted wool skirt both from Barneys and a silk blouse by Andra Gabrielle Theyre definitely paying attention to the four of us and we repay the compliment turning our heads except for Price who ignores them and says something rude\\n   Jesus Christ Price lighten up McDermott whines Whats your problem Those girls werevery hot\\n   Yeah if you speak Farsi Price says handing McDermott a couple of drink tickets as if to placate him\\n   What Van Patten says They didnt look Spanish to me\\n   You know Price youre going to have to change your attitude if you want to get laid McDermott says\\n   Youretellingmeabout getting laid Price asks Craig You who scored with a hand job the other night\\n   Your outlooksucks Price Craig says\\n   Listen you think I act like I do around you guys when I want somepussy Price challenges\\n   Yeah Ido McDermott and Van Patten say at the same time\\n   You know I say its possible to act differently from how one actually feels to get sex guys I hope Im not causing you to relose your innocence McDermott I start walking faster trying to keep up with Tim\\n   No but that doesnt explain why Tim acts like such amajorasshole McDermott says trying to catch up with me\\n   Like these girlscare Price snorts When I tell them what my annual income is believe me my behavior couldnt matter less\\n   And how do you drop this little tidbit of info Van Patten asks Do you say Heres a Corona and by the way I pull in a hundred eighty thou a year and whats your sign\\n   One ninety Price corrects him and then Yeah I do Subtlety is not what these girls are after\\n   And what are these girls after O knowledgeable one McDermott asks bowing slightly as he walks\\n   Van Patten laughs and still in motion they give each other highfive\\n   Hey I laugh you wouldnt ask if youknew\\n   They want a hardbody who can take them to Le Cirque twice a week get them into Nells on a regular basis Or maybe a close personal acquaintance of Donald Trump Price says flatly\\n   We hand our tickets to an okaylooking girl wearing a woolmelton duffel coat and a silk scarf from Herms As she lets us in Price winks at her and McDermott is saying I worry about disease just walking into this place These are some skanky chicks I can justfeelit\\n   I told you dude Van Patten says and then patiently restates his facts We cant getthat Its like zero zero zero point oh one percentage\\n   Luckily the long version of New Sensation by INXS drowns out his voice The music is so loud that conversation is possible only by screaming The club is fairly packed the only real light coming in flashes off the dance floor Everyone is wearing a tuxedo Everyone is drinking champagne Since we only have two VIP Basement passes Price shoves them at McDermott and Van Patten and they eagerly wave the cards at the guy guarding the top of the stairs The guy who lets them pass is wearing a doublebreasted wool tuxedo a cotton wingcollar shirt by Cerruti  and a black and white checkered silk bow tie from Martin Dingman Neckwear\\n   Hey I shout to Price Why didntweuse those\\n   Because he screams over the music grabbing me by the collar we need some Bolivian Marching Powder\\n   I follow him as he rushes through the narrow corridor that runs parallel to the dance floor then into the bar and finally into the Chandelier Room which is jammed with guys from Drexel from Lehmans from Kidder Peabody from First Boston from Morgan Stanley from Rothschild from Goldman even fromCitibankfor Christ sakes all of them wearing tuxedos holding champagne flutes and effortlessly almost as if it were the same song New Sensation segues into The Devil Inside and Price spots Ted Madison leaning against the railing in the back of the room wearing a doublebreasted wool tuxedo a wingcollar cotton shirt from Paul Smith a bow tie and cummerbund from Rainbow Neckwear diamond studs from Trianon patentleather and grosgrain pumps by Ferragamo and an antique Hamilton watch from Saks and past Madison disappearing into darkness are the twin train tracks which tonight are lit garishly in preppy greens and pinks and Price suddenly stops walking stares past Ted who smiles knowingly when he spots Timothy and Price gazes longingly at the tracks as if they suggest some kind of freedom embody an escape that Price has been searching for but I shout out to him Hey theres Teddy and this breaks his gaze and he shakes his head as if to clear it refocuses his gaze on Madison and shouts decisively No thats not Madison for Christ sakes thatsTurnball and the guy who I thought was Madison is greeted by two other guys in tuxedos and he turns his back to us and suddenly behind Price Ebersol wraps an arm around Timothys neck and laughingly pretends to strangle him then Price pushes the arm away shakes Ebersols hand and says Hey Madison\\n   Madison who I thought was Ebersol is wearing a splendid doublebreasted white linen jacket by Hackett of London from Bergdorf Goodman He has a cigar that hasnt been lit in one hand and a champagne glass half full in the other\\n   Mr Price shouts Madison Very good to see you sir\\n   Madison Price cries back We need your services\\n   Looking for trouble Madison smiles\\n   Something more immediate Price shouts back\\n   Of course Madison shouts and then coolly for some reason nods at me shouting I think Bateman and then Nice tan\\n   A guy standing behind Madison who looks a lot like Ted Dreyer is wearing a doublebreasted shawlcollared tuxedo a cotton shirt and a silk tartan bow tie all of it Im fairly sure from Polo by Ralph Lauren Madison stands around nodding to various people who pass by in the crush\\n   Finally Price loses his cool Listen We need drugs I think I hear him shout\\n   Patience Price patience Madison shouts Ill talk to Ricardo\\n   But he still stands there nodding to people who push past\\n   Like what aboutnow Price screams\\n   Why arent you wearing a tux Madison shouts\\n   How much do we want Price asks me looking desperate\\n   A gram is fine I shout I have to be at the office early tomorrow\\n   Do you have cash\\n   I cant lie nod hand him forty\\n   A gram Price shouts to Ted\\n   Hey Madison says introducing his friend this is You\\n   A gram Price presses cash into Madison s hand You What\\n   This guy and Madison both smile and Ted shakes his head and shouts a name I cant hear\\n   No Madison shouts Hugh I think\\n   Yeah Great to meet you Hugh Price holds up his wrist and taps the gold Rolex with his index finger\\n   Ill be right back Madison shouts Keep my friend company Use your drink tickets He disappears You Hugh Who fades into the crowd I follow Price over to the railings\\n   I want to light my cigar but dont have any matches yet just holding it catching some of its aroma along with the knowledge that drugs are incoming comforts me and I take two of the drink tickets from Price and try to get him a Finlandia on the rocks which they dont have the hardbody behind the bar informs me bitchily but shes got a rad body and is so hotlooking that I will leave her a big tip because of this I settle on an Absolut for Price and order a JB on the rocks for myself As a joke I almost bring Tim a Bellini but he seems far too edgy tonight to appreciate this so I wade back through the crowd to where he stands and hand him the Absolut and he takes it thanklessly and finishes it with one gulp looks at the glass and grimaces giving me an accusatory look I shrug helplessly He resumes staring at the train tracks as if possessed There are very few chicks in Tunnel tonight\\n   Hey Im going out with Courtney tomorrow night\\n   Her he shouts back staring at the tracks Great Even with the noise I catch the sarcasm\\n   Well whynot Carruthers isoutof town\\n   Might as well hire someone from anescortservice he shouts bitterly almost without thinking\\n   Why I shout\\n   Because shes gonna cost you alotmore to get laid\\n   Noway I scream\\n   Listen I put up with it too Price shouts lightly shaking his glass Ice cubes clank loudly surprising me Merediths the same way She expects to be paid Theyalldo\\n   Price I take a large gulp of Scotch Youre priceless\\n   He points behind him Where do those tracks go Laser lights start flashing\\n   I dont know I say after a long time I dont even know how long\\n   I get bored watching Price who is neither moving nor speaking The only reason he occasionally turns away from the train tracks is to look for Madison or Ricardo No women anywhere just an army of professionals from Wall Street in tuxedos The one female spotted is dancing alone in a corner to some song I think is called Love Triangle Shes wearing what looks like a sequined tank top by Ronaldus Shamask and I concentrate on that but Im in an edgy precoke state and I start chewing nervously on a drink ticket and some Wall Street guy who looks like Boris Cunningham blocks my view of the girl Im about to head off to the bar when Madison comes back its been twenty minutes  and he sniffs loudly a big plastered jittery grin on his face as he shakes hands with a sweaty sternlooking Price who moves away so quickly that when Ted tries to slap him in a friendly sort of way on his back he just hits air\\n   I follow Price back past the bar and the dance floor past the basement and upstairs past the long line for the womens room which is strange since there seem to be no women at the club tonight and then were in the mens room which is empty and Price and I slip into one of the stalls together and he bolts the door\\n   Im shaking Price says handing me the small envelope You open it\\n   I take it from him carefully unfolding the edges of the tiny white package exposing the supposed gram it looks like less to the dim fluorescent light of the mens room\\n   Jeez Price whispers in a surprisingly gentle way Thats not a helluva lot is it He leans forward to inspect it\\n   Maybe its just the light I mention\\n   What the fuck is Ricardos problem Price asks gaping at the coke\\n   Shhh I whisper taking out my platinum American Express card Lets just do it\\n   Is he fucking selling it by themilligram Price asks He sticks his own platinum American Express card into the powder bringing it up to his nose to inhale it He stands there silently for a moment and then gasps Oh my god in a low throaty voice\\n   What I ask\\n   Its a fucking milligram ofSweetn Low he chokes\\n   I do some of it and come to the same conclusion Its definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it well be okay But Price is furious redfaced and sweating he screams at me as if this was my fault as if buying the gram from Madison wasmy idea\\n   I want to get high off this Bateman Price says slowly his voice rising Not sprinkle it on my fucking AllBran\\n   You can always put it in your caf au lait this prissy voice in the next stall cries out\\n   Price stares at me eyes widening in disbelief then flies into a rage and whirls around pounding his fist against the side of the stall\\n   Calm down I tell him Lets do it anyway\\n   Price turns back to me and after running a hand over his stiff slickedback hair seems to relent I guess youre right and then he raises his voice that is if the faggot in the next stall thinks its okay\\n   We wait for a sign and then the voice in the next stall finally lisps Its okay with me\\n   Fuck yourself Price roars\\n   Fuckyourself the voice mimics\\n   Nofuck yourself Price screams back trying to scramble over the aluminum divider but I pull him down with one hand and in the next stall the toilet flushes and the unidentified person obviously unnerved scampers out of the mens room Price leans against the door of our stall and stares at me in this hopeless way He rubs a trembling hand over his stillcrimson face and shuts his eyes tightly lips white slight residue of cocaine under one nostril and then quietly he says without opening his eyes Okay Lets do it\\n   Thatsthe spirit I say We take turns digging our respective cards into the envelope until what we cant get with the cards we press our fingers into and snort or lick off the tips then rub into our gums Im not anywhere near high but another JB might give the body a false enough impression to kick in some kind of rush no matter how weak\\n   Stepping out of the stall we wash our hands inspecting our reflections in the mirror and once satisfied head back to the Chandelier Room Im beginning to wish Id checked my overcoat Armani but no matter what Price says I feel kind of high and minutes later as I wait at the bar trying to get this hardbodys attention it starts not to matter I finally have to lay a twenty on the counter to get her attention even though I have plenty of drink tickets left It works Taking advantage of the drink tickets I order two double Stolis on the rocks She pours the drinks in front of me\\n   Im feeling good and I shout out to her Hey dont you go to NYU\\n   She shakes her head unsmiling\\n   Hunter I shout\\n   She shakes her head again Not Hunter\\n   Columbia I shout though thats a joke\\n   She continues to concentrate on the bottle of Stoli I decide not to continue the conversation and just slap the drink tickets on the bar as she places the two glasses in front of me But she shakes her head and shouts Its after eleven Those arent good anymore Its a cash bar Thatll be twentyfive dollars and without complaining playing it totally cool I pull out my gazelleskin wallet and hand her a fifty which she eyes I swear contemptuously and sighing turns to the cash register and finds my change and I say staring at her quite clearly but muffed by Pump Up the Volume and the crowd You are a fucking ugly bitch I want to stab to death and play around with your blood but Im smiling I leave the cunt no tip and find Price who is standing again morosely by the railings his hands gripping the steel bars Paul Owen who is handling the Fisher account is wearing a sixbutton doublebreasted wool tuxedo and he stands next to Price screaming something like Ran five hundred iterations of discounted cash flow minus on an ICM PC took company cab to Smith and Wollensky\\n   I hand the drink to Price while nodding to Paul Price says nothing not even thanks He just holds the drink and mournfully stares at the tracks and then he squints and bends his head down to the glass and when the strobe lights start flashing he stands up straight and murmurs something to himself\\n   Arent you high I ask him\\n   How are you Owen shouts\\n   Very happy I say\\n   The music is one long unending song that overlaps with other separate songs connected only by a dull thumping beat and it obliterates all conversation which while Im talking to a weasel like Owen is perfectly okay with me There seem to be more girls in the Chandelier Room now and I try to make eye contact with one of them model type with big tits Price nudges me and I lean in to ask if we should perhaps get another am\\n   Why arent you wearing a tuxedo Owen asks behind me\\n   Im leaving Price shouts Im getting out\\n   Leaving what I shout back confused\\n   This he shouts referring to Im not sure but I think his double Stoli\\n   Dont I tell him Ill drink it\\n   Listen to me Patrick he screams Imleaving\\n   Where to I really am confused You want me to find Ricardo\\n   Im leaving he screams I amleaving\\n   I start laughing not knowing what he means Wellwhereare you going to go\\n   Away he shouts\\n   Dont tell me I shout back at him Merchant banking\\n   No Bateman Im serious you dumb sonofabitchLeaving Disappearing\\n   Where to Im still laughing stilt confused still shouting Morgan Stanley RehabWhat\\n   He looks away from me doesnt answer just keeps staring past the railings trying to find the point where the tracks come to an end find what lies behind the blackness Hes becoming a drag but Owen seems worse and Ive already accidentally made eye contact with the weasel\\n   Tell him dont worry be happy Owen shouts\\n   Are you still handling the Fisher account What else can I say to him\\n   What Owen asks Wait Is that Conrad\\n   He points at some guy wearing a shawlcollar singlebreasted wool tuxedo a cotton shirt with a bow tie all by Pierre Cardin who stands near the bar directly beneath the chandelier holding a glass of champagne inspecting his nails Owen pulls out a cigar then asks for a light Im bored so I go for the bar without excusing myself to ask the hardbody I want to cut up for some matches The Chandelier Room is packed and everyone looks familiar everyone looks the same Cigar smoke hangs heavy floating in midair and the music INXS again is louder than ever but building toward what I touch my brow by mistake and my fingers come back wet At the bar I pick up some matches On my way back through the crowd I bump into McDermott and Van Patten who start begging me for more drink tickets I hand them the rest of the tickets knowing that they are no longer valid but were crushed together in the middle of the room and the drink tickets dont offer enough incentive for them to make the trek to the bar\\n   Skanky chicks Van Patten says Beware No hardbodies\\n   Basement sucks McDermott shouts\\n   Did you find drugs Van Patten shouts We saw Ricardo\\n   No I shout Negative Madison couldnt find any\\n   Service damnit service the guy behind me shouts\\n   Its useless I shout I cant hear anything\\n   What Van Patten shouts I cant hear anything\\n   Suddenly McDermott grabs my arm What the fuck is Price doing Look\\n   As in a movie I turn around with some difficulty standing on my toes to see Price perched on the rails trying to balance himself and someone has handed him a champagne glass and drunk or wired he holds both arms out and closes his eyes as if blessing the crowd Behind him the strobe light continues to flash off and on and off and on and the smoke machine is going like crazy gray mist billowing up enveloping him Hes shouting something but I cant hear what the room is jammed to overcapacity the sound level an earsplitting combination of Eddie Murphys Party All the Time and the constant din of businessmen  so I push my way forward my eyes glued on Price and manage to pass Madison and Hugh and Turnball and Cunningham and a few others But the crowd is too densely packed and its futile to even keep trying Only a few of the faces are fixated on Tim still balancing on the railing eyes half closed shouting something Embarrassed Im suddenly glad Im stuck in the crowd unable to reach him to save him from almost certain humiliation and during a perfectly timed byte of silence I can hear Price shout Goodbye and then the crowd finally paying attention Fuckheads Gracefully he twists his body around and hops over the railing and leaps onto the tracks and starts running the champagne flute bobbing as he holds it out to his side He stumbles once twice with the strobe light flashing in what looks like slow motion but he regains his composure before disappearing into blackness A security guard sits idly by the railing as Price recedes into the tunnel He just shakes his head I think\\n   Price Come back I yell but the crowd is actually applauding his performance Price I yell once more over the clapping But hes gone and its doubtful that if hedid hear me he would do anything about it Madison is standing nearby and sticks his hand out as if to congratulate me for something That guys ariot\\n   McDermott appears behind me and pulls at my shoulder Does Price know about a VIP room that we dont He looks worried\\n   Outside Tunnel now Im high but really tired and my mouth tastes surprisingly like NutraSweet even after drinking two more Stolis and half a JB Twelvethirty and we watch limousines try to make left turns onto the West Side Highway The three of us Van Patten McDermott and myself discuss the possibilities of finding this new club called Nekenieh Im not really high just sort of drunk\\n   Lunch I ask them yawning Tomorrow\\n   Cant McDermott says Haircut at the Pierre\\n   What about breakfast I suggest\\n   Nope Van Patten says Gios Manicure\\n   That reminds me I say inspecting a hand I need one too\\n   How about dinner McDermott asks me\\n   Ive got a date I say Shit\\n   What about you McDermott asks Van Patten\\n   No can do Van Patten says Ive got to go to Sunmakers Then private workout\\n   Office\\n   In the elevator Frederick Dibble tells me about an item on Page Six or some other gossip column about Ivana Trump and then about this new ItalianThai place on the Upper East Side that he went to last night with Family Hamilton and starts raving about this great fusilli shiitake dish I have taken out a gold Cross pen to write down the name of the restaurant in my address book Dibble is wearing a subtly striped doublebreasted wool suit by Canali Milano a cotton shirt by Bill Blass a miniglenplaid woven silk tie by Bill Blass Signature and hes holding a Missoni Uomo raincoat He has a goodlooking expensive haircut and I stare at it admiringly while he starts humming along to the Muzak station a version of what could be Sympathy for the Devil  that plays throughout all the elevators in the building our offices are in Im about to ask Dibble if he watched The Patty Winters Show this morning  the topic was Autism  but he gets out on the floor before mine and repeats the name of the restaurant Thaidialano and then See you Marcus and steps out of the elevator The doors shut I am wearing a minihoundstoothcheck wool suit with pleated trousers by Hugo Boss a silk tie also by Hugo Boss a cotton broadcloth shirt by Joseph Abboud and shoes from Brooks Brothers I flossed too hard this morning and I can still taste the coppery residue of swallowed blood in the back of my throat I used Listerine afterwards and my mouth feels like its on fire but I manage a smile to no one as I step out of the elevator brushing past a hungover Wittenborn swinging my new black leather attach case from Bottega Veneta\\n   My secretary Jean who is in love with me and who I will probably end up marrying sits at her desk and this morning to get my attention as usual is wearing something improbably expensive and completely inappropriate a Chanel cashmere cardigan a cashmere crewneck and a cashmere scarf fauxpearl earrings woolcrepe pants from Barneys I pull my Walkman off from around my neck as I approach her desk She looks up and smiles shyly\\n   Late she asks\\n   Aerobics class I play it cool Sorry Any messages\\n   Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today she says He didnt say what it was he is canceling or why\\n   I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club I explain Anyone else\\n   And Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier  she says smiling\\n   When I ask\\n   After six\\n   Negative I tell her as I walk into my office Cancel it\\n   She gets up from behind her desk and follows me in Oh And what should I say she asks amused\\n   Just say no I tell her taking my Armani overcoat off and hanging it on the Alex Loeb coatrack I bought at Bloomingdates\\n   Just say no she repeats\\n   Did you seeThe Patty Winters Showthis morning I ask On Autism\\n   No She smiles as if somehow charmed by my addiction toThe Patty Winters Show How was it\\n   I pick up this morningsWall Street Journal and scan the front page all of it one inkstained senseless typeset blur I think I was hallucinating while watching it I dont know I cant be sure I dont remember I murmur placing theJournalback down and then picking up todaysFinancial TimesI really dont know She just stands there waiting for instructions I sigh and place my hands together sitting down at the Palazzetti glasstop desk the halogen lamps on both sides already burning Okay Jean I start I need reservations for three at Camols at twelvethirty and if not there try Crayons All right\\n   Yes sir she says in a joky tone and then turns to leave\\n   Oh wait I say remembering something And I need reservations for two at Arcadia at eight tonight\\n   She turns around her face falling slightly but still smiling Oh something romantic\\n   No silly Forget it I tell her Ill make them Thanks\\n   Ill do it she says\\n   No No I say waving her off Be a doll and just get me a Perrier okay\\n   You look nice today she says before leaving\\n   Shes right but Im not saying anything just staring across the office at the George Stubbs painting that hangs on the wall wondering if I should move it thinking maybe its too close to the Aiwa AMFM stereo receiver and the dual cassette recorder and the semiautomatic beltdrive turntable the graphic equalizer the matching bookshelf speakers all in twilight blue to match the color scheme of the office The Stubbs painting should probably go over the lifesize Doberman thats in the corner  at Beauty and the Beast in Trump Tower or maybe it would look better over the Pacrizinni antique table that sits next to the Doberman I get up and move all these sporting magazines from the forties  they cost me thirty bucksapiecethat I bought at Funchies Bunkers Gaks and Gleeks and then I lift the Stubbs painting off the wall and balance it on the table then sit back at my desk and fiddle with the pencils I keep in a vintage German beer stein I got from Mantiques The Stubbs looks good in either place A reproduction Black Forest umbrella stand  at Hubert des Forges sits in an other corner without Im just noticing any umbrellas in it\\n   I put a Paul Butterfield tape in the cassette player sit back at the desk and flip through last weeksSports Illustrated but cant concentrate I keep thinking about that damn tanning bed Van Patten has and Im moved to pick up the phone and buzz jean\\n   Yes she answers\\n   Jean Listen keep your eyes open for a tanning bed okay\\n   What she asks incredulously Im sure but shes still probably smiling\\n   You know A tanning bed I repeat casually For a tan\\n   Okay  she says hesitantly Anything else\\n   And oh shit yeah Remind me to return the videotapes I rented last night back to the store I start to open and close the sterling silver cigar holder that sits by the phone\\n   Anything else she asks and then flirtatiously How about that Perrier\\n   Yeah That sounds good And Jean\\n   Yes she says and Im relieved by her patience\\n   You dont think Im crazy I ask I mean for wanting a tanning bed\\n   Theres a pause and then Well it is a little unusual she admits and I can tell she is choosing her wordsverycarefully But no of course not I mean how else are you going to keep up that devilishly handsome skin tone\\n   Good girl I say before hanging up I have a great secretary\\n   She comes into the office five minutes later with the Perrier a wedge of lime and the Ransom file which she did not need to bring and I am vaguely touched by her almost total devotion to me I cant help but be flattered\\n   You have a table at Camols at twelvethirty she announces as she pours the Perrier into a glass tumbler Nonsmoking section\\n   Dont wear that outfit again I say looking her over quickly Thanks for the Ransom file\\n   Um She stalls about to hand me the Perrier and asks What I didnt hear you before setting the drink on my desk\\n   I said and I repeat myself calmly grinning do not wear that outfit again Wear a dress A skirt or something\\n   She stands there only a little stunned and after she looks down at herself she smiles like some kind of cretin You dont like this I take it she says humbly\\n   Come on I say sipping my Perrier Youre prettier than that\\n   Thanks Patrick she says sarcastically though I bet tomorrow shell be wearing a dress The phone on her desk rings I tell her Im not here She turns to leave\\n   And high heels I mention I like high heels\\n   She shakes her head goodnaturedly as she exits shutting my door behind her I take out a Panasonic pocket watch with a threeinch diagonal color TV and an AMFM radio and try to find something to watch hopefullyJeopardybefore turning to my computer terminal\\n   Health Club\\n   The health club I belong to Xclusive is private and located four blocks from my apartment on the Upper West Side In the two years since I signed up as a member it has been remodeled three times and though they carry the latest weight machines Nautilus Universal Keiser they have a vast array of free weights which I like to use also The club has ten courts for tennis and racquetball aerobics classes four aerobic dance studios two swimming pools Lifecycles a Gravitron machine rowing machines treadmills crosscountry skiing machines oneonone training cardiovascular evaluations personalized programs massage sauna and steam rooms a sun deck tanning booths and a caf with a juice bar all of it designed by J J Vogel who designed the new Norman Prager club Pettys Membership runs five thousand dollars annually\\n   It was cool this morning but seems warmer after I leave the office and Im wearing a sixbutton doublebreasted chalkstriped suit by Ralph Lauren with a spreadcollar pencilstriped Sea Island cotton shirt with French cuffs also by Polo and I remove the clothes gratefully in the airconditioned locker room then slip into a pair of crowblack cotton and Lycra shorts with a white waistband and side stripes and a cotton and Lycra tank top both by Wilkes which can be folded so tightly that I can actually carry them in my briefcase After getting dressed and putting my Walkman on clipping its body to the Lycra shorts and placing the phones over my ears a Stephen BishopChristopher Cross compilation tape Todd Hunter made for me I check myself in the mirror before entering the gym and dissatisfied go back to my briefcase for some mousse to slick my hair back and then I use a moisturizer and for a small blemish I notice under my lower lip a dab of Clinique TouchStick Satisfied I turn the Walkman on the volume up and leave the locker room\\n   Cheryl this dumpy chick who is in love with me sits at her desk up front signing people in reading one of the gossip columns in thePost and she brightens up noticeably when she sees me approaching She says hello but I move past her quickly barely registering her presence since theres no line at the Stairmaster for which usually one has to wait twenty minutes With the Stairmaster you work the bodys largest muscle group between the pelvis and knees and you can end up burning more calories per minute than by doing any other aerobic activity except maybe Nordic skiing\\n   I should probably be stretching first but if I do that Ill have to wait in line already some faggot is behind me probably checking out my back ass leg muscles No hardbodies at the gym today Only faggots from the West Side probably unemployed actors waiters by night and Muldwyn Butner of Sachs who I went to Exeter with over at the biceps curl machine Butner is wearing a pair of kneelength nylon and Lycra shorts with checkerboard inserts and a cotton and Lycra tank top and leather Reeboks I finish twenty minutes on the Stairmaster and let the overmuscled bleachedblond middleaged faggot behind me use it and I commence with stretching exercises While I stretchThe Patty Winters ShowI watched this morning comes back to me The topic was Big Breasts and there was a woman on it who had a breast reductionsince she thought her tits were too big the dumb bitch I immediately called McDermott who was also watching it and we both ridiculed the woman through the rest of the segment I do about fifteen minutes of stretching before heading off to the Nautilus machines\\n   I used to have a personal trainer whom Luis Carruthers had recommended but he came on to me last fall and I decided to develop my own fitness program which incorporates both aerobic exercises and training With weights I alternate between free weights and weight machines that use hydraulic pneumatic or electromechanical resistance Most of the machines are very efficient since computerized keypads allow one to make adjustments in weight resistance without getting up The positive aspects of the machines include minimizing muscle soreness and reducing any chance of injury But I also like the versatility and freedom that free weights offer and the many variations in lifting that I cant get on the machines\\n   On the leg machines I do five sets of ten repetitions For the back I also do five sets of ten repetitions On the stomach crunch machine Ive gotten so I can do six sets of fifteen and on the biceps curl machine I do seven sets of ten Before moving to the free weights I spend twenty minutes on the exercise bike while reading the new issue ofMoneymagazine Over at the free weights I do three sets of fifteen repetitions of leg extensions leg curls and leg presses then three sets and twenty repetitions of barbell curls then three sets and twenty repetitions of bentover lateral raises for the rear deltoids and three sets and twenty repetitions of latissimus pulldowns pulley rows dead lifts and bentover barbell rows For the chest I do three sets and twenty reps of inclinebench presses For the front deltoids I also do three sets of lateral raises and seated dumbbell presses Finally for the triceps I do three sets and twenty reps of cable pushdowns and closegrip bench presses After more stretching exercises to cool down I take a quick hot shower and then head to the video store where I return two tapes I rented on MondaySheMale ReformatoryandBody Doublebut I rerentBody Doublebecause I want to watch it again tonight even though I know I wont have enough time to masturbate over the scene where the woman is getting drilled to death by a power drill since I have a date with Courtney at seventhirty at Caf Luxembourg\\n   Date\\n   Heading home from working out at Xclusive and after an intense shiatsu massage I stop at a newsstand near my building scanning the Adults Only rack with my Walkman still on the soothing strains of Pachelbels Canon somehow complementing the harshly lit laminated photographs in the magazines I flip through I buyLesbian Vibrator BitchesandCunt on Cuntalong with the currentSports Illustratedand the new issue ofEsquireeven though I subscribe to them and both have already arrived in the mail I wait until the stand is empty to make my purchase The vendor says something motions toward his hook nose while handing me the magazines along with my change I lower the volume and lift one of the Walkmans earphones up and ask What He touches his nose again and in a thick nearly impenetrable accent says I think Nose uise bleding I put my Bottega Veneta briefcase down and lift a finger up to my face It comes away red wet with blood I reach into my Hugo Boss overcoat and bring out a Polo handkerchief and wipe the blood away nod my thanks slip my Wayfarer aviator sunglasses back on and leave Fucking Iranian\\n   In the lobby of my building I stop at the front desk and try to get the attention of a black Hispanic doorman I dont recognize Hes on the phone to his wife or his dealer of some crack addict and stares at me as he nods the phone cradled in the premature folds of his neck When it dawns on him that I want to ask something he sighs rolls his eyes up and tells whoever is on the line to hold on Yeah whatchooneed he mumbles\\n   Yes I begin my tone as gentle and polite as I can possibly muster Could you please tell the superintendent that I have a crack in my ceiling and I stop\\n   Hes looking at me as if I have overstepped some kind of unspoken boundary and Im beginning to wonder what word confused him certainly notcrack so what was itSuperintendent CeilingMaybe evenplease\\n   Whatchoomean He sighs thickly slumped back still staring at me\\n   I look down at the marble floor and also sigh and tell him Look I dont know Just tell the superintendent its Bateman in Ten I When I bring my head back up to see if any of this has registered Im greeted by the expressionless mask of the doormans heavy stupid face I am a ghost to this man Im thinking I am something unreal something not quite tangible yet still an obstacle of sorts and he nods gets back on the phone resumes speaking in a dialect totally alien to me\\n   I collect my mail Polo catalog American Express bill JunePlayboy invitation to an office party at a new club called Bedlam then walk to the elevator step in while inspecting the Ralph Lauren brochure and press the button for my floor and then the Close Door button but someone gets in right before the doors shut and instinctively I turn to say hello Its the actor Tom Cruise who lives in the penthouse and as a courtesy without asking him I press the PH button and he nods thank you and keeps his eyes fixed on the numbers lighting up above the door in rapid succession He is much shorter in person and hes wearing the same pair of black Wayfarers I have on Hes dressed in blue jeans a white Tshirt an Armani jacket\\n   To break the noticeably uncomfortable silence I clear my throat and say I thought you were very fine inBartender I thought it was quite a good movie andTop Guntoo I really thought that was good\\n   He looks away from the numbers and then straight at me It was calledCocktail he says softly\\n   Pardon I say confused\\n   He clears his throat and says CocktailNotBartenderThe film was calledCocktail\\n   A long pause follows just the sound of cables moving the elevator up higher into the building competes with the silence obvious and heavy between us\\n   Oh yeah Right I say as if the title just dawned on me CocktailOh yeah thats right I say Great Bateman what are you thinking about I shake my head as if to clear it and then to patch things up hold out my hand Hi Pat Bateman\\n   Cruise tentatively shakes it\\n   So I go You like living in this building\\n   He waits a long time before answering I guess\\n   Its great I say Isnt it\\n   He nods not looking at me and I press the button for my floor again an almost involuntary reaction We stand there in silence\\n   SoCocktail I say after a while Thats the name\\n   He doesnt say anything doesnt even nod but now hes looking at me strangely and he lowers his sunglasses and says with a slight grimace Uh your nose is bleeding\\n   I stand there rock still for a moment before understanding that I have to do something about this so I pretend to be suitably embarrassed quizzically touch my nose then bring out my Polo handkerchief already spotted brown  and wipe the blood away from my nostrils overall handling it sort of well Must be the altitude I laugh Were up so high\\n   He nods says nothing looks up at the numbers\\n   The elevator stops at my floor and when the doors open I tell Tom Im a big fan Its really good to finally meet you\\n   Oh yeah right Cruise smiles that famous grin and jabs at the Close Door button\\n   The girl Im going out with tonight Patricia Worrell blond model dropped out of Sweet Briar recently after only one semester  has left two messages on the answering machine letting me know how incredibly important it is that I call her While loosening my Matisseinspired blue silk tie from Bill Robinson I dial her number and walk across the apartment cordless phone in hand to flip on the airconditioning\\n   She answers on the third ring Hello\\n   Patricia Hi Its Pat Bateman\\n   Oh hi she says Listen Im on the other line Can I call you back\\n   Well I say\\n   Look its my health club she says Theyve screwed up my account Ill call you back in a sec\\n   Yeah I say and hang up\\n   I go into the bedroom and take off what I was wearing today a herringbone wool suit with pleated trousers by Ciorgio Correggiari a cotton oxford shirt by Ralph Lauren a knit tie from Paul Stuart and suede shoes from ColeHaan I slip on a pair of sixtydollar boxer shorts I bought at Barneys and do some stretching exercises holding the phone waiting for Patricia to call back After ten minutes of stretching the phone rings and I wait six rings to answer it\\n   Hi she says Its me Patricia\\n   Could you hold on Ive got another call\\n   Oh sure she says\\n   I put her on hold for two minutes then get back on the line Hi I say Sorry\\n   Thats okay\\n   So Dinner I say Stop by my place around eight\\n   Well thats what I wanted to talk to you about she says slowly\\n   Oh no I moan What is it\\n   Well see its like this she begins Theres this concert at Radio City and\\n   No no no I tell her adamantly No music\\n   But my exboyfriend this keyboardist from Sarah Lawrence hes in the backup band and She stops as if she has already decided to protest my decision\\n   No Uhuh Patricia I tell her firmly thinking to myself Damnit whythisproblem whytonight\\n   Oh Patrick she whines into the phone Itll be so much fun\\n   I am now fairly sure that the odds of having sex with Patricia this evening are quite good but not if we attend a concert in which an exboyfriend there is no such thing with Patricia is in the backup band\\n   I dont like concerts I tell her walking into the kitchen I open the refrigerator and take out a liter of Evian I dont like concerts I say again I dont like live music\\n   But this one isnt like theothers She lamely adds Wehavegood seats\\n   Listen Theres no need to argue I say If you want to gogo\\n   But I thought we were going to be together she says straining for emotion I thought we were going to havedinner and then almost definitely an afterthought Be togetherThetwoof us\\n   I know I know I say Listen we should all be allowed to do exactly what wewantto doIwant you to do whatyouwant to do\\n   She pauses and tries a new angle Mis music is so beautiful so I know it sounds corny but its glorious The band is one of the best youll ever see Theyre funny and wonderful and the music is so great and oh gosh I just want you to see them so badly Well have a great time I guarantee it she says with dripping earnestness\\n   No no you go I say You have a good time\\n   Patrick she says I havetwo tickets\\n   No I dont like concerts I say Live musicbugsme\\n   Well she says and her voice sounds genuinely tinged with maybe real disappointment Ill feel bad that youre not there with me\\n   I say go and have a good time I unscrew the cap off the Evian bottle timing my next move Dont worry Ill just go to Dorsia alone then Its okay\\n   There is a very long pause that I am able to translate into Uhhuh right now see if you want to go to that lousy fucking concert I take a large gulp of Evian waiting for her to tell me what time shell be over\\n   Dorsia she asks and then suspiciously You have reservations there I mean for us\\n   Yes I say Eightthirty\\n   Well She emits a little laugh and then faltering It was well what I mean isIveseen them I just wantedyouto see them\\n   Listen What are you doing I ask If youre not coming I have to call someone else Do you have Emily Hamiltons number\\n   Oh now now Patrick dont berash She giggles nervously Theyareplaying two more nights so Icansee them tomorrow Listen calm down okay\\n   Okay I say Im calm\\n   Now what time should I be over Restaurant Whore asks\\n   I said eight I tell her disgusted\\n   Thats fine she says and then in a seductive whisper See you at eight She lingers on the phone as if she expects me to say something else as if maybe I should congratulate her for making the correct decision but I hardly have time to deal with this so I abruptly hang up\\n   The instant after I hang up on Patricia I dash across the room and grab the Zagat guide and flip through it until I find Dorsia With trembling fingers I dial the number Busy Panicked I put the phone on Constant Redial and for the next five minutes nothing but a busy signal faithful and ominous repeats itself across the line Finally a ring and in the seconds before theres an answer I experience that rarest of occurrences an adrenaline rush\\n   Dorsia someone answers sex not easily identifiable made androgynous by the wallofsound noise in the background Please hold\\n   It sounds slightly less noisy than a packed football stadium and it takes every ounce of courage I can muster to stay on the line and not hang up Im on hold for five minutes my palm sweaty sore from clenching the cordless phone so tightly a fraction of me realizing the futility of this effort another part hopeful another fraction pissed off that I didnt make the reservations earlier or get Jean to The voice comes back on the lire and says grufliy Dorsia\\n   I clear my throat Um yes I know its a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eightthirty or nine perhaps Im asking this with both eyes shut tight\\n   There is a pause the crowd in the background a surging deafening mass  and with real hope coursing through me I open my eyes realizing that the matre d god love him is probably looking through the reservation book for a cancellation  but then he starts giggling low at first but it builds to a highpitched crescendo of laughter which is abruptly cut off when he slams down the receiver\\n   Stunned feverish feeling empty I contemplate the next move the only sound the dial tone buzzing noisily from the receiver Gather my bearings count to six reopen the Zagat guide and steadily regain my concentration against the almost overwhelming panic about securing an eightthirty reservation somewhere if not as trendy as Dorsia then at least in the nextbest league I eventually get a reservation at Barcadia for two at nine and thatonlybecause of a cancellation and though Patricia will probably be disappointed she might actually like Barcadia the tables are well spaced the lighting is dim and flattering the food Nouvelle Southwestern  and if she doesnt what is the bitch going to dosue me\\n   I worked out heavily at the gym after leaving the office today but the tension has returned so I do ninety abdominal crunches a hundred and fifty pushups and then I run in place for twenty minutes while listening to the new Huey Lewis CD I take a hot shower and afterwards use a new facial scrub by CaswellMassey and a body wash by Greune then a body moisturizer by Lubriderm and a Neutrogena facial cream I debate between two outfits One is a woolcrepe suit by Bill Robinson I bought at Saks with this cotton jacquard shirt from Charivari and an Armani tie Or a wool and cashmere sport coat with blue plaid a cotton shirt and pleated wool trousers by Alexander Julian with a polkadot silk tie by Bill Blass The Julian might be a little too warm for May but if Patricias wearing this outfit by Karl Lagerfeld that Ithinkshes going to then maybe Iwillgo with the Julian because it would go well withhersuit The shoes are crocodile loafers by A Testoni\\n   A bottle of Scharffenberger is on ice in a Spiros spunaluminum bowl which is in a Christine Van der Hurd etchedglass champagne cooler which sits on a Cristofle silverplated bar tray The Scharffenberger isnt bad its not Cristal but why waste Cristal on this bimbo She probably wouldnt be able to tell the difference anyway I have a glass of it while waiting for her occasionally rearranging the Steuben animals on the glasstop coffee table by Turchin or sometimes I flip through the last hardcover book I bought something by Garrison Keillor Patricia is late\\n   While waiting on the couch in the living room the Wurlitzer jukebox playing Cherish by the Lovin Spoonful I come to the conclusion that Patricia is safe tonight that I am not going to unexpectedly pull a knife out and use it on her just for the sake of doing so that I am not going to get any pleasure watching her bleed from slits Ive made by cutting her throat or slicing her neck open or gouging her eyes out Shes lucky even though there is no real reasoning behind the luck It could be that shes safe because her wealth herfamilyswealth protects her tonight or it could be that its simplymychoice Maybe the glass of Scharffenberger has deadened my impulse or maybe its simply that I dont want to ruin this particular Alexander Julian suit by having the bitch spray her blood all over it Whatever happens the useless fact remains Patricia will stay alive and this victory requires no skill no leaps of the imagination no ingenuity on anyones part This is simply how the world my world moves\\n   She arrives thirty minutes late and I tell the doorman to let her up even though I meet her outside my door while Im locking it She isnt wearing the Karl Lagerfeld suit I expected but she looks pretty decent anyway a silk gazar blouse with rhinestone cuff links by Louis DellOlio and a pair of embroidered velvet pants from Saks crystal earrings by Wendy Gell for Anne Klein and gold slingback pumps I wait until were in the cab heading midtown to tell her about not going to Dorsia and then I apologize profusely mention something about disconnected phone lines a fire a vengeful matre d She gives a little gasp when I drop the news ignores the apologies and turns away from me to glare out the window I try to placate her by describing how trendy howluxuriousthe restaurant were going to is explaining its pasta with fennel and banana itssorbets but she only shakes her head and then Im reduced to telling her oh Christ about how Barcadia has gotten much more expensive even than Dorsia but she is relentless Her eyes I swear intermittently tear\\n   She doesnt say anything until were seated at a mediocre table near the back section of the main dining room and thats only to order a Bellini For dinner I order the shadroe ravioli with apple compote as an appetizer and the meat loaf with chvre and quailstock sauce for an entre She orders the red snapper with violets and pine nuts and for an appetizer a peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash which sounds strange but is actually quite goodNew Yorkmagazine called it a playful but mysterious little dish and I repeat this to Patricia who lights a cigarette while ignoring my lit match sulkily slumped in her seat exhaling smoke directly into my face occasionally shooting furious looks at me which I politely ignore being the gentleman that I can be Once our plates arrive I just stare at my dinner the meat loaf dark red triangles topped by chvre which has been tinted pink by pomegranate juice squiggles of thick tan quail stock circling the beef and mango slices dotting the rim of the wide black plate  for a long time a little confused before deciding to eat it hesitantly picking up my fork\\n   Even though dinner lasts only ninety minutes it feels as if we have been sitting in Barcadia for a week and though I have no desire to visit Tunnel afterwards it seems appropriate punishment for Patricias behavior The bill comes to  less than I expected actually  and I put it on my platinum AmEx In the cab heading downtown my eyes locked on the meter our driver tries to make conversation with Patricia who completely ignores him while checking her makeup in a Gucci compact adding lipstick to an already heavily colored mouth There was a baseball game on tonight that I think I forgot to videotape so I wont be able to watch it when I get home but I remember that I bought two magazines after work today and I can always spend an hour or so poring over those I check my Rolex and realize that if we have one drinkmaybe two Ill get home in time forLate Night with David LettermanThough physically Patricia is appealing and I wouldnt mind having sex with her body the idea of treating her gently of being a kind date of apologizing for this evening for not being able to get into Dorsia even though Barcadia is twiceas expensive for Christ sakes rubs me the wrong way The bitch is probably pissed we dont have a limo\\n   The cab stops outside Tunnel I pay the fare and leave the driver a decent tip and hold the door open for Patricia who ignores my hand when I try to help her step out of the cab No one stands outside the ropes tonight In fact the only person on Twentyfourth Street is a bum who sits by a Dumpster writhing in pain moaning for change or food and we pass quickly by him as one of the three doormen who stand behind the ropes lets us in another one patting me on the back saying How are you Mr McCullough I nod opening the door for Patricia and before following her in say Fine uh Jim and I shake his hand\\n   Once inside after paying fifty dollars for the two of us I head immediately to the bar without really caring if Patricia follows I order a JB on the rocks She wants a Perrier no lime and orders this herself After I down half the drink leaning against the bar and checking the hardbody waitress out something suddenly seems out of place its not the lighting or INXS singing New Sensation or the hardbody behind the bar Its something else When I slowly turn around to take in the rest of the club Im confronted by space that is completely deserted Patricia and myself are the only two customers in the entire club We are except for the occasional hardbody literally theonly two people in TunnelNew Sensation becomes The Devil Inside and the music is full blast but it feels less loud because there isnt a crowd reacting to it and the dance floor looks vast when empty\\n   I move away from the bar and decide to check out the clubs other areas expecting Patricia to follow but she doesnt No one guards the stairs that lead to the basement and as I step down them the music from upstairs changes melds itself into Belinda Carlisle singing I Feel Free The basement has one couple in it who look like Sam and Ilene Sanford but its darker down herewarmerand I could be wrong I move past them as they stand by the bar drinking champagne and head over toward this extremely welldressed Mexicanlooking guy sitting on a couch Hes wearing a doublebreasted wool jacket and matching trousers by Mario Valentino a cotton Tshirt by Agnes B and leather slipons no socks by Susan Bennis Warren Edwards and hes with a goodlooking muscular Eurotrash chick dirty blond big tits tan no makeup smoking Merit Ultra Lights  who has on a cotton gown with a zebra print by Patrick Kelly and silk and rhinestone highheeled pumps\\n   I ask the guy if his name is Ricardo\\n   He nods Sure\\n   I ask for a gram tell him Madison sent me I pull my wallet out and hand over a fifty and two twenties He asks the Eurotrash chick for her purse She hands him a velvet bag by Anne Moore Ricardo reaches in and hands me a tiny folded envelope Before I leave the Eurotrash girl tells me she likes my gazelleskin wallet I tell her I would like to titfuck her and then maybe cut her arms off but the music George Michael singing Faith is too loud and she cant hear me\\n   Back upstairs I find Patricia where I left her alone at the bar nursing a Perrier\\n   Listen Patrick she says her attitude relenting I just want you to know that Im\\n   A bitch Listen do you want to do some coke I shout cutting her line off\\n   Uh yeah Sure Shes wildly confused\\n   Come on I yell taking her hand\\n   She puts her drink down on the bar and follows me through the deserted club up the stairs toward the rest rooms Theres really no reason why we couldnt do it downstairs but that seems tacky and so we do most of it in one of the mens room stalls Back outside the mens room I sit on a couch and smoke one of her cigarettes while she goes downstairs to get us drinks\\n   She comes back apologizing for her behavior earlier this evening I mean I loved Barcadia the food was outstanding and that mango sorbet ohmygod I was in heaven Listen its okay that we didnt go to Dorsia We can always go some other night and I know that you probably tried to get us in but its just so hot right now But oh yeah I really loved the food at Barcadia How long has it been open I think its been three four months I read a great review inNew Yorkor maybe it wasGourmet But anyway do you want to come with me to this band tomorrow night or maybe we can go to Dorsia and then see Wallaces band or maybe go to Dorsia after but maybe its not even open that late Patrick Im serious you should really see them Avatar is such a great lead singer and I actually thought I was in love with him once  well actually I was in lust not love I really liked Wallace then but he was into this whole investment banking thing and he couldnt handle the routine and he broke down it was the acid not the cocaine that did it I mean Iknowbut so when that all fell apart I knew that it would be like best to just hang out and not deal with\\n   JB I am thinking Glass of JB in my right hand I am thinking Hand I am thinking Charivari Shirt from Charivari Fusilli I am thinking Jami Gertz I am thinking I would like to fuck Jami Gertz I am thinking Porsche  A sharpei I am thinking I would like to own a sharpei I am twentysix years old I am thinking I will be twentyseven next year A Valium I would like a Valium Notwo Valium I am thinking Cellular phone I am thinking\\n   Dry Cleaners\\n   The Chinese dry cleaners I usually send my bloody clothes to delivered back to me yesterday a Soprani jacket two white Brooks Brothers shirts and a tie from Agnes B still covered with flecks of someones blood I have a lunch appointment at noon in forty minutes  and beforehand I decide to stop by the cleaners and complain In addition to the Soprani jacket the shirts and tie I bring along a bag of bloodstained sheets that also need cleaning The Chinese dry cleaners is located twenty blocks up from my apartment on the West Side almost by Columbia and since Ive never actually been there before the distance shocks me previously my clothes were always picked up after a phone call from my apartment and then were delivered back within twentyfour hours Because of this excursion I have no time for a morning workout and since I overslept owing to a latenightpredawn coke binge with Charles Griffin and Hilton Ashbury that started innocently enough at a magazine party none of us were invited to at MK and ended at my automated teller sometime around five Ive missedThe Patty Winters Showwhich actually was a repeat of an interview with the President so it doesnt really matter I guess\\n   Im tense my hair is slicked back Wayfarers on my skull is aching I have a cigar unlit  clenched between my teeth am wearing a black Armani suit a white cotton Armani shirt and a silk tie also by Armani I look sharp but my stomach is doing flipflops my brain is churning On my way into the Chinese cleaners I brush past a crying bum an old man forty or fifty fat and grizzled and just as Im opening the door I notice to top it off that hes alsoblindand I step on his foot which is actually a stump causing him to drop his cup scattering change all over the sidewalk Did I do this on purpose What do you think Or did I do this accidentally\\n   Then for ten minutes I point out the stains to the tiny old Chinese woman who Im supposing runs the cleaners and shes even brought her husband out from the back of the shop since I cant understand a word shes saying But the husband remains utterly mute and doesnt bother to translate The old woman keeps jabbering in what I guess is Chinese and finally I have to interrupt\\n   Listen wait I hold up a hand with the cigar in it the Soprani jacket draped over my other arm Youre not shhh wait shhh you are notgiving mevalidreasons\\n   The Chinese woman keeps squealing something grabbing at the arms of the jacket with a tiny fist I brush her hand away and leaning in speak very slowly What areyoutrying to say tome\\n   She keeps yipping wildeyed The husband holds the two sheets hes taken out of the bag in front of him both splattered with dried blood and stares at them dumbly\\n   Bleachee I ask her Are you trying to saybleachee I shake my head disbelieving Bleachee Oh my god\\n   She keeps pointing at the sleeves on the Soprani jacket and when she turns to the two sheets behind her the yipping voice rises another octave\\n   Two things I say talking over her One You cant bleach a Soprani Out of the question Two and then louder still over her  two I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe These are very expensive sheets and Ireally need them clean   But shes still talking and Im nodding as if I understand her gibberish then I break into a smile and lean right into her face IfyoudontshutyourfuckingmouthIwillkillyouareyouunderstandingme\\n   The Chinese womans panicked jabbering speeds up incoherently her eyes still wide Her face overall maybe because of the wrinkles seems oddly expressionless Pathetically I point at the stains again but then realize this is useless and lower my hand straining to understand what shes saying Then casually I cut her off talking over her again\\n   Now listen I have a very important lunch meeting I check my Rolex  at Huberts in thirty minutes  then looking back at the womans flat slanty  eyed faceand I need those no waittwentyminutes I have a lunch meeting at Huberts in twenty minutes with Ronald Harrison and I need those sheets cleaned by this afternoon\\n   But shes not listening she keeps blabbering something in the same spastic foreign tongue I have never firebombed anything and I start wondering how one goes about it what materials are involved gasoline matches or would it be lighter fluid\\n   Listen I snap out of it and sincerely in singsong leaning into her face her mouth moving chaotically she turns to her husband who nods during a rare brief pause  I tell her Icannotunderstand you\\n   Im laughing appalled at how ridiculous this situation is and slapping a hand on the counter look around the shop for someone else to talk to but its empty and I mutter This is crazy I sigh rubbing a hand over my face and then abruptly stop laughing suddenly furious I snarl at her Youre afool Icantcope with this\\n   She jabbers something back at me\\n   What I ask spitefully You didnt hear me You want some ham Is that what you just said You want someham\\n   She grabs at the arm of the Soprani jacket again Her husband stands behind the counter sullen and detached\\n   You are a fool I bellow\\n   She jabbers back undaunted pointing relentlessly at the stains on the sheets\\n   Stupid bitchee Understand I shout redfaced on the verge of tears Im shaking and I yank the jacket away from her muttering Oh Christ\\n   Behind me the door opens and a bell chimes and I compose myself Close my eyes breathe in deeply remind myself about stopping in at the tanning salon after lunch maybe Herms or\\n   Patrick\\n   Jolted by the sound of a real voice I turn around and its someone I recognize from my building someone Ive seen a number of times lingering in the lobby staring admiringly at me whenever I run into her Shes older than me late twenties okaylooking a little overweight wearing a jogging suit from where Bloomingdales I have no idea  and shes beamingTaking off her sunglasses she offers a wide smile Hi Patrick I thought it was you\\n   Having no idea what her name is I sigh a muted Hello then very quickly mumble something that resembles a womans name and then I just stare at her stumped drained trying to control my viciousness the Chinese woman still screeching behind me Finally I clap my hands together and say Well\\n   She stands there confused until nervously moving toward the counter ticket in hand Isnt it ridiculous Comingallthe way upherebut you know they reallyarethe best\\n   Then why cant they getthesestains out I ask patiently still smiling both eyes closed until the Chinese woman has finally shut up and then I open them I mean can you talk to these people orsomething I delicately propose Im not gettinganywhere\\n   She moves toward the sheet the old man holds up Oh my I see she murmurs The moment she tentatively touches the sheet the old lady starts jabbering away and ignoring her the girl asks me Whatare those She looks at the stains again and says Oh my\\n   Um well I look over at the sheets which are really quite a mess Its um cranberry juice cranapple juice\\n   She looks at me and nods as if unsure then timidly ventures It doesnt look like cranberry I mean cranapple to me\\n   I stare at the sheets for a long time before stammering Well I mean um its reallyBosco You know like I pause Like a Dove Bar Its a Dove Bar Hersheys Syrup\\n   Oh yeah She nods understanding maybe a hint of skepticism Oh my\\n   Listen if you could talk to them I reach over yanking the sheet out of the old mans hand  I wouldreallyappreciate it I fold the sheet and lay it gently on the counter then checking my Rolex again explain Im really late I have a lunch appointment at Huberts in fifteen minutes I move toward the door of the dry cleaners and the Chinese woman starts yapping again desperately shaking a finger at me I glare at her forcing myself not to mimic the hand gestures\\n   Huberts Ohreally the girl asks impressed It moved uptown right\\n   Yeah well oh boy listen Ive got to go I pretend to spot an oncoming cab across the street through the glass door and faking gratitude tell her Thank you uh Samantha\\n   Its Victoria\\n   Oh right Victoria I pause Didnt I say that\\n   No You said Samantha\\n   Well Im sorry I smile Im having problems\\n   Maybe we could have lunch one day next week she suggests hopefully moving toward me while Im backing out of the store You know Im downtown near Wall Street quite often\\n   Oh I dont know Victoria I force an apologetic grin avert my gaze from her thighs Im at work all the time\\n   Well what about oh you know maybe a Saturday Victoria asks afraid shell offend\\n   Next Saturday I ask checking my Rolex again\\n   Yeah She shrugs timidly\\n   Oh Cant Im afraid Matinee ofLes Misrables I lie Listen Ivereallygot to go Ill I run a hand over my hair and mutter Oh Christ before forcing myself to add Ill call you\\n   Okay She smiles relieved Do\\n   I glare at the Chinese woman once more and rush the hell out of there dashing after a nonexistent cab and then I slow down a block or two up past the cleaners and\\n    suddenly I find myself eyeing a very pretty homeless girl sitting on the steps of a brownstone on Amsterdam a Styrofoam coffee cup resting on the step below her feet and as if guided by radar I move toward her smiling fishing around in my pocket for change Her face seems too young and fresh and tan for a homeless persons it makes her plight all the more heartbreaking I examine her carefully in the seconds it takes to move from the edge of the sidewalk to the steps leading up to the brownstone where she sits her head bowed down staring dumbly into her empty lap She looks up unsmiling after she notices me standing over her My nastiness vanishes and wanting to offer something kind something simple I lean in still staring eyes radiating sympathy into her blank grave face and dropping a dollar into the Styrofoam cup I say Good luck\\n   Her expression changes and because of this I notice the book Sartre  in her lap and then the Columbia book bag by her side and finally the tancolored coffee in the cup and my dollar bill floating in it and though this all happens in a matter of seconds its played out in slow motion and she looks at me then at the cup and shouts Hey whats your goddamn problem and frozen hunched over the cup cringing I stutter I didnt I didnt know it was full and shaken I walk away hailing a taxi and heading toward Huberts in it I hallucinate the buildings into mountains into volcanoes the streets become jungles the sky freezes intoa backdrop and before stepping out of the cab I have to cross my eyes in order to clear my vision Lunch at Huberts becomes a permanent hallucination in which I find myself dreaming while still awake\\n   Harrys\\n   You should match the socks with the trousers Todd Hamlin tells Reeves who is listening intently stirring his Beefeater on the rocks with a swizzle stick\\n   Who says George asks\\n   Now listen Hamlin patiently explains If you weargraytrousers you weargraysocks Its as simple as that\\n   But wait I interrupt What if the shoes areblack\\n   Thats okay Hamlin says sipping his martini But then the belt has tomatchthe shoes\\n   So what youre saying is that with agraysuit you can either wear gray or blacksocks I ask\\n   Er yeah Hamlin says confused I guess Did I say that\\n   See Hamlin I say I disagree about the belt since the shoes are so far away from the actualbelt line I think you should concentrate on wearing a belt that coordinates with thetrousers\\n   Hehasa point Reeves says\\n   The three of us Todd Hamlin and George Reeves and myself are sitting in Harrys and its a little after six Hamlin is wearing a suit by Lubiam a greatlooking striped spreadcollar cotton shirt from Burberry a silk tie by Resikeio and a belt from Ralph Lauren Reeves is wearing a sixbutton doublebreasted suit by Christian Dior a cotton shirt a patterned silk tie by Claiborne perforated captoe leather laceups by AllenEdmonds a cotton handkerchief in his pocket probably from Brooks Brothers sunglasses by Lafont Paris lie on a napkin by his drink and a fairly nice attach case from T Anthony rests on an empty chair by our table Im wearing a twobutton singlebreasted chalkstriped woolflannel suit a multicolored candystriped cotton shirt and a silk pocket square all by Patrick Aubert a polkadot silk tie by Bill Blass and clear prescription eyeglasses with frames by Lafont Paris One of our CD Walkman headsets lies in the middle of the table surrounded by drinks and a calculator Reeves and Hamlin left the office early today for facials somewhere and they both look good faces pink but tan hair short and slicked backThe Patty Winters Showthis morning was about RealLife Rambos\\n   But what about vests Reeves asks Todd Arent theyout\\n   No George Hamlin says Ofcoursenot\\n   No I agree Vests haveneverbeen out of fashion\\n   Well the question reallyis how should they be worn Hamlin inquires\\n   They should fit Reeves and I start simultaneously\\n   Oh sorry Reeves says Go ahead\\n   No its okay I say You go ahead\\n   I insist George says\\n   Well they should fit trimly around the body and cover the waistline I say It should peek just above the waist button of the suit jacket Now if too much of the vest appears itll give the suit a tight constricted look that you dont want\\n   Uhhuh Reeves says nearly mute looking confused Right I knew that\\n   I need another JB I say getting up Guys\\n   Beefeater on rocks with a twist Reeves pointing at me\\n   Hamlin Martini\\n   Sure thing I walk over toward the bar and while waiting for Freddy to pour the drinks I hear some guy I think its this Greek William Theodocropopolis from First Boston whos wearing a sort of tacky wool jacket in a houndstooth check and an okaylooking shirt but he also has on a superlooking cashmere tie from Paul Stuart that makes the suit look better than it deserves to and hes telling some guy another Greek drinking a Diet Coke So listen Sting was at Chernoble you know that place the guys who opened Tunnel opened  and so this was on Page Six and someone drives up in a Porsche  and in the car was Whitney and\\n   Back at our table Reeves is telling Hamlin about how he taunts the homeless in the streets about how he hands a dollar to them as he approaches and then yanks it away and pockets it right when he passes the bums\\n   Listen itworks he insists Theyre so shocked they shutup\\n   Just say no I tell him setting the drinks on the table Thatsall you have to say\\n   Just say no Hamlin smiles It works\\n   Well actually only with pregnant homeless women I admit\\n   I take it you havent tried the justsayno approach with the sevenfoot gorilla on Chambers Street Reeves asks The one with the crack pipe\\n   Listen hasanyone heard of this club called Nekenieh Reeves asks\\n   From my POV Paul Owen sits at a table across the room with someone who looks a lot like Trent Moore or Roger Daley and some other guy who looks like Frederick Connell Moores grandfather owns the company he works at Trent is wearing a minihoundstoothcheck worsted wool suit with multicolored overplaid\\n   Nekenieh Hamlin asks Whats Nekenieh\\n   Guys guys I say Whos sitting with Paul Owen over there Is that Trent Moore\\n   Where Reeves\\n   Theyre getting up That table I say Those guys\\n   Isnt that Madison No its Dibble Reeves says He puts on his clear prescription eyeglasses just to make sure\\n   No Hamlin says Its Trent Moore\\n   Are you sure Reeves asks\\n   Paul Owen stops by our table on his way out Hes wearing sunglasses by Persol and hes carrying a briefcase by Coach Leatherware\\n   Hello men Owen says and he introduces the two guys hes with Trent Moore and someone named Paul Denton\\n   Reeves and Hamlin and I shake their hands without standing up George and Todd start talking to Trent who is from Los Angeles and knows where Nekenieh is located Owen turns his attention my way which makes me slightly nervous\\n   How have you been Owen asks\\n   Ive been great I say And you\\n   Oh terrific he says Hows the Hawkins account going\\n   Its I stall and then continue faltering momentarily Its all right\\n   Really he asks vaguely concerned Thats interesting he says smiling hands clasped together behind his back Notgreat\\n   Oh well I say You know\\n   And hows Marcia he asks still smiling looking over the room not really listening to me Shes agreatgirl\\n   Oh yes I say shaken Im lucky\\n   Owen has mistaken me for Marcus Halberstam even though Marcus is dating Cecelia Wagner but for some reason it really doesnt matter and it seems a logical faux pas since Marcus works at P P also in fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a penchant for Valentino suits and clear prescription glasses and we share the same barber at the same place the Pierre Hotel so it seems understandable it doesnt irk me But Paul Denton keeps staring at me or trying not to as if he knows something as if hes not quite sure if he recognizes me or not and it makes me wonder if maybe he was on that cruise a long time ago one night last March If thats the case Im thinking I should get his telephone number or better yet his address\\n   Well we should have drinks I tell Owen\\n   Great he says Lets Heres my card\\n   Thanks I say looking at it closely relieved by its crudeness before slipping it into my jacket Maybe Ill bring I pause then carefully say Marcia\\n   That would begreat he says Hey have you been to that Salvadorian bistro on Eightythird he asks Were eating there tonight\\n   Yeah I mean no I say But Ive heard its quite good I smile weakly and take a sip of my drink\\n   Yes so have I He checks his Rolex Trent Denton Lets split Reservations in fifteenminutes\\n   Goodbyes are said and on their way out of Harrys they stop by the table Dibble and Hamilton are sitting at or at least Ithinkits Dibble and Hamilton Before they leave Denton looks over at our table at me one last time and he seems panicked convinced of something by my presence as if he recognized me from somewhere and this in turn freaksmeout\\n   The Fisher account Reeves says\\n   Oh shit I say Dont remind us\\n   Lucky bastard Hamlin says\\n   Has anyone seen his girlfriend Reeves asks Laurie Kennedy Total hardbody\\n   I know her I say admit I knew her\\n   Why do you say it like that Hamlin asks intrigued Whydoes he say it like that Reeves\\n   Because hedatedher Reeves says casually\\n   How did you know that I ask smiling\\n   Girls dig Bateman Reeves sounds a little drunk HesGQ Youretotal GQ Bateman\\n   Thanks guy but I cant tell if hes being sarcastic but it makes me feel proud in a way and I try to downplay my good looks by saying Shes got alousypersonality\\n   Oh Christ Bateman Hamlin groans What doesthatmean\\n   What I say She does\\n   So what Its alllooks Laurie Kennedy is ababe Hamlin says emphatically Dont even pretend you were interested foranyother reason\\n   If they have a good personality then something is very wrong Reeves says somehow confused by his own statement\\n   If they have a good personality and they arenotgreatlooking Reeves holds his hands up signifying something  who fuckingcares\\n   Well lets just sayhypothetically okay Whatifthey have a good personality I ask knowing full well what a hopeless asinine question it is\\n   FineHypothetically even better but Hamlin says\\n   I know I know I smile\\n   Thereareno girls with good personalities we all say in unison laughing giving each other highfive\\n   A good personality Reeves begins consists of a chick who has a little hardbody and who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep her dumb fucking mouthshut\\n   Listen Hamlin says nodding in agreement The only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or even talented though god knows what the fuckthatmeans are ugly chicks\\n   Absolutely Reeves nods\\n   And this is because they have to make up for how fuckingunattractivethey are Hamlin says sitting back in his chair\\n   Well my theorys always been I start men are only here to procreate to carry on the species you know\\n   They both nod\\n   And so the only way to do that I continue choosing words carefully is to get turned on by a little hardbody but sometimesmoneyorfame\\n   Nobuts Hamlin says interrupting Bateman are you telling me that youre gonna make it with Oprah Winfrey hey shes rich shes powerful  or go down on Nell Carter  hey shes got a show on Broadway a great voice residuals pouring in\\n   Wait Reeves says Whois Nell Carter\\n   I dont know I say confused by the name She owns Nells I guess\\n   Listen to me Bateman Hamlin says The only reason chicks exist is to get us turned on like you said Survival of the species right Its as simple he lifts an olive out of his drink and pops it into his mouth  as that\\n   After a deliberate pause I say Do you know what Ed Gein said about women\\n   Ed Gein one of them asks Matre d at Canal Bar\\n   No I say Serial killer Wisconsin in the fifties He was an interesting guy\\n   Youve always been interested in stuff like that Bateman Reeves says and then to Hamlin Bateman reads these biographies all the time Ted Bundy and Son of Sam andFatal Vision and Charlie Manson All of them\\n   So what did Ed say Hamlin asks interested\\n   He said I begin  When I see a pretty girl walking down the street I think two things One part of me wants to take her out and talk to her and be real nice and sweet and treat her right  I stop finish my JB in one swallow\\n   What does the other part of him think Hamlin asks tentatively\\n   What her head would look like on a stick I say\\n   Hamlin and Reeves look at each other and then back at me before I start laughing and then the two of them uneasily join in\\n   Listen what about dinner I say casually changing subjects\\n   How about that IndianCalifornian place on the Upper West Side Hamlin suggests\\n   Fine with me I say\\n   Sounds good Reeves says\\n   Wholl make the rez Hamlin asks\\n   Deck Chairs\\n   Courtney Lawrence invites me out to dinner on Monday night and the invitation seems vaguely sexual so I accept but part of the catch is that we have to endure dinner with two Camden graduates Scott and Anne Smiley at a new restaurant they chose on Columbus called Deck Chairs a place I had my secretary research so thoroughly that she presented me with three alternative menus of what I should order before I left the office today The things that Courtney told me about Scott and Anne he works at an advertising agency she opens restaurants with her fathers money most recently  on the Upper East Side  on the interminable cab ride uptown was only slightly less interesting than hearing about Courtneys day facial at Elizabeth Arden buying kitchen utensils at the Pottery Barn all of this by the way on lithium before coming down to Harrys where we had drinks with Charles Murphy and Rusty Webster and where Courtney forgot the bag of Pottery Barn utensils shed put underneath our table The only detail of Scott and Annes life that seems even remotely suggestive to me is that they adopted a Korean boy of thirteen the year after they married named him Scott Jr and sent him to Exeter where Scott had gone to school four years before I attended\\n   They better have reservations I warn Courtney in the cab\\n   Just dont smoke a cigar Patrick she says slowly\\n   Is that Donald Trumps car I ask looking over at the limousine stuck next to us in gridlock\\n   Oh god Patrick Shut up she says her voice thick and drugged\\n   You know Courtney I have a Walkman in my Bottega Veneta briefcase I could easily put on I say You should take some more lithium Or have a Diet Coke Some caffeine might get you out of this slump\\n   I just want to have a child she says softly staring out the window to no one Just two perfect children\\n   Are you talking to me or Shlomo here I sigh but loudly enough for the Israeli driver to hear me and predictably Courtney doesnt say anything\\n   The Patty Winters Showthis morning was about Perfumes and Lipsticks and Makeups Luis Carruthers Courtneys boyfriend is out of town in Phoenix and will not be back in Manhattan until late Thursday Courtney is wearing a wool jacket and vest a wool jersey Tshirt and wool gabardine pants by Bill Blass crystal enamel and gold plated earrings by Gerard E Yosca and silksatin dOrsay pumps from Manolo Blahnik I am wearing a custommade tweed jacket pants and a cotton shirt from the Alan Flusser shop and a silk tie by Paul Stuart There was a twentyminute wait at the Stairmaster machine at my health club this morning I wave to a beggar on the corner of Fortyninth and Eighth then give him the finger\\n   Tonight the talk centers around Elmore Leonards new book which I havent read certain restaurant critics  who I have the British sound track fromLes Misrablesversus the American cast recording that new Salvadorian bistro on Second and Eightythird and which gossip columns are better written thePosts or theNewss It seems that Anne Smiley and I share a mutual acquaintance a waitress from Abetones in Aspen who I raped with a can of hairspray last Christmas when I was skiing there over the holidays Deck Chairs is crowded earsplitting the acoustics lousy because of the high ceilings and if Im not mistaken accompanying the din is a New Age version of White Rabbit blaring from speakers mounted in the ceiling corners Someone who looks like Forrest Atwater slickedback blond hair nonprescription redwoodframed glasses Armani suit with suspenders  is sitting with Caroline Baker an investment banker at Drexel maybe and she doesnt look too good She needs more makeup the Ralph Lauren tweed outfit is too severe Theyre at a mediocre table up front by the bar\\n   Its called Californiaclassiccuisine Anne tells me leaning in close after we ordered The statement deserves a reaction I suppose and since Scott and Courtney are discussing the merits of thePosts gossip column its up to me to reply\\n   You mean compared to say Californiacuisine I ask carefully measuring each word then lamely add OrpostCalifornia cuisine\\n   I mean I know it sounds so trendy but thereis a world of difference Itssubtle she says but itsthere\\n   Ive heard of postCalifornia cuisine I say acutely aware of the design of the restaurant the exposed pipe and the columns and the open pizza kitchen and the deck chairs In fact Ive even eaten it No baby vegetables Scallops in burritos Wasabi crackers Am I on the right track And by the way did anyone ever tell you that you look exactly like Garfield but run over and skinned and then someone threw an ugly Ferragamo sweater over you before they rushed you to the vet Fusilli Olive oil on Brie\\n   Exactly Anne says impressed Oh Courtney wheredidyou find Patrick Hes so knowledgeable about things I mean Luiss idea of California cuisine is half an orange and somegelati she gushes then laughs encouraging me to laugh with her which I do hesitantly\\n   For an appetizer I ordered radicchio with some kind of freerange squid Anne and Scott both had the monkfish ragout with violets Courtney almost fell asleep when she had to exert the energy to read the menu but before she slid off her chair I grabbed both shoulders propping her up and Anne ordered for her something simple and light like Cajun popcorn perhaps which wasnt on the menu but since Anne knows Noj the chef he made up a special little batchjust for CourtneyScott and Anne insisted that we all order some kind of blackened mediumrare redfish a Desk Chairs specialty which was luckily for them an entre on one of the mock menus that Jean made up for me If it hadnt and if they nevertheless insisted on my ordering it the odds were pretty good that after dinner tonight I would have broken into Scott and Annes studio at around two this morning  afterLate Night with David Letterman and with an ax chopped them to pieces first making Anne watch Scott bleed to death from gaping chest wounds and then I would have found a way to get to Exeter where I would pour a bottle of acid all over their sons slantyeyed zipperhead face Our waitress is a little hardbody who is wearinggold fauxpearl tasseled lizard slingback pumps I forgot to return my videotapes to the store tonight and I curse myself silently while Scott orders two large bottles of San Pellegrino\\n   Its called Californiaclassiccuisine Scott is telling me\\n   Why dont we all go to Zeus Bar next week Anne suggests to Scott You think wed have a problem getting a table on Friday Scott is wearing a red and purple and black striped cashmere intarsia sweater from Paul Stuart baggy Ralph Lauren corduroys and ColeHaan leather moccasins\\n   Well maybe he says\\n   Thats a good idea Ilikeit a lot Anne says picking up a small violet off her plate and sniffing the flower before placing it carefully on her tongue Shes wearing a red purple and black handknitted mohair and wool sweater from Koos Van Den Akker Couture and slacks from Anne Klein with suede opentoe pumps\\n   A waiter though not the hardbody strides over to take another drink order\\n   JB Straight I say before anyone else orders\\n   Courtney orders a champagne on the rocks which secretly appalls me Oh she says as if reminded by something can I have that with a twist\\n   A twist ofwhat I ask irritably unable to stop myself Let me guessMelon And Im thinking oh my god why didnt you return those goddamn videos Bateman you dumb sonofabitch\\n   You meanlemon miss the waiter says giving me an icy stare\\n   Yes of course Lemon Courtney nods seeming lost in some kind of dream but enjoying it oblivious to it\\n   Ill have a glass of the oh gosh I guess the Acacia Scott says and then addresses the table Do I want a white Do I really want a chardonnay We can eat the redfish with a cabernet\\n   Go for it Anne says cheerily\\n   Okay Ill have the oh jeez the sauvignon blanc Scott says\\n   The waiter smiles confused\\n   Scottie Anne shrieks The sauvignonblanc\\n   Just teasing he snickers Ill have the chardonnay The Acacia\\n   You completejerk Anne smiles relieved Yourefunny\\n   Im having the chardonnay Scott tells the waiter\\n   Thats nice Courtney says patting Scotts hand\\n   Ill just have Anne stalls deliberating Oh Ill just have a Diet Coke\\n   Scott looks up from a piece of corn bread he was dipping into a small tin of olive oil Youre not drinking tonight\\n   No Anne says smiling naughtily Who knows why And who fucking cares Im not in the mood\\n   Not even for a glass of the chardonnay Scott asks How about a sauvignon blanc\\n   I have this aerobics class at nine she says slipping losing control I really shouldnt\\n   Well then I dont want anything Scott says disappointed I mean I have one at eight at Xclusive\\n   Does anyone want to guess where Iwontbe tomorrow morning at eight I ask\\n   No honey I know how much you like the Acacia Anne reaches out and squeezes Scotts hand\\n   No babe Ill stick to the Pellegrino Scott says pointing\\n   Im tapping my fingers very loudly on the tabletop whispering shit shit shit shit to myself Courtneys eyes are half closed and shes breathing deeply\\n   Listen Ill bedaring Anne says finally Ill have a Diet Coke withrum\\n   Scott sighs then smiles beaming really Good\\n   Thats acaffeinefineDiet Coke right Anne asks the waiter\\n   You know I interrupt you should have it with Diet Pepsi Its much better\\n   Really Anne asks What do you mean\\n   You should have the Diet Pepsi instead of the Diet Coke I say Its much better Its fizzier It has a cleaner taste It mixes better with rum and has a lower sodium content\\n   The waiter Scott Anne and even Courtney they all stare at me as if Ive offered some kind of diabolical apocalyptic observation as if I were shattering a myth highly held or destroying an oath that was solemnly regarded and it suddenly seems almost hushed in Deck Chairs Last night I rented a movie calledInside Lydias Assand while on two Halcion and in fact sipping a Diet Pepsi I watched as Lydia a totally tan bleachedblonde hardbody with a perfect ass and great full tits  while on all fours gave head to this guy with a huge cock while another gorgeous blonde little hardbody with a perfectly trimmed blond pussy knelt behind Lydia and after eating her ass out and sucking on her cunt started to push a long greased silver vibrator into Lydias ass and fucked her with it while she continued to eat her pussy and the guy with the huge cock came all over Lydias face as she sucked his balls and then Lydia bucked to an authenticlooking fairly strong orgasm and then the girl behind Lydia crawled around and licked the come from Lydias face and then made Lydia suck on the vibrator The new Stephen Bishop came out last Tuesday and at Tower Records yesterday I bought the compact disc the cassette and the album because I wanted to own all three formats\\n   Listen I say my voice trembling with emotion have whatever you want but Im telling you I recommend the Diet Pepsi I look down at my lap at the blue cloth napkin the words Deck Chairs sewn into the napkins edge and for a moment think Im going to cry my chin trembles and I cant swallow\\n   Courtney reaches over and touches my wrist gently stroking my Rolex Its okay Patrick It really is\\n   A sharp pain near my liver overcomes the surge of emotion and I sit up in my chair startled confused and the waiter leaves and then Anne asks if weve seen the recent David Onica exhibit and Im feeling calmer\\n   It turns out we havent seen the show but I dont want to be tacky enough to bring up the fact I own one so I lightly kick Courtney under the table This raises her out of the lithiuminduced stupor and she says robotically Patrick owns an Onica He really does\\n   I smile pleased sip my JB\\n   Oh thats fantastic Patrick Anne says\\n   Really An Onica Scott asks Isnt hequiteexpensive\\n   Well lets just say I sip my drink suddenly confused say say what Nothing\\n   Courtney sighs anticipating another kick Patricks cost twenty thousand dollars She seems bored out of her mind picking at a flat warm piece of corn bread\\n   I give her a sharp look and try not to hiss Uh no Courtney it was reallyfifty\\n   She slowly looks up from the corn bread shes mashing between her fingers and even in her lithium haze manages a stare so malicious that it automatically humbles me but not enough to tell Scott and Anne the truth that the Onica cost only twelve grand But Courtneys frightening gaze though I might be overreacting she might be staring disapprovingly at the patterns on the columns the venetian blinds on the skylight the Montigo vases full of purple tulips lining the bar  scares me enough to not elaborate on the procedure of purchasing an Onica Its a stare that I can interpret fairly easily It warns Kick me again and no pussy do you understand\\n   That seems Anne starts\\n   I hold my breath my face tight with tension\\n   low she murmurs\\n   I exhale Itis But I got a fabulous deal I say gulping\\n   Butfiftythousand Scott asks suspiciously\\n   Well I think his work it has a kind of wonderfully proportioned purposefully mocksuperficial quality I pause then trying to remember a line from a review I saw inNew York magazine Purposefully mock\\n   Doesnt Luis own one Courtney Anne asks and then tapping Courtneys arm Courtney\\n   Luis owns what Courtney shakes her head as if to clear it widening her eyes to make sure they dont close on her\\n   Whos Luis Scott asks waving to the waitress to have the butter the busboy recently placed on the table removed what aparty animal\\n   Anne answers for Courtney Herboyfriend she says after seeing Courtney confused actually looking at me for help\\n   Wheres he at Scott asks\\n   Texas I say quickly Hes out of town in Phoenix I mean\\n   No Scott says I meant whathouse\\n   L F Rothschild Anne says about to look at Courtney for confirmation but then at me Right\\n   No Hes at P P I say We work together sort of\\n   Wasnt he dating Samantha Stevens at one point Anne asks\\n   No Courtney says That was just a photo someone took of them that was inW\\n   I down my drink as soon as it arrives and wave almost immediately for another and Im thinking Courtneyis a babe but no sex is worth this dinner The conversation violently shifts while Im staring across the room at a greatlooking woman blonde big tits tight dress satin pumps with gold cones  when Scott starts telling me about his new compact disc player while Anne unwittingly prattles on to a stoned and completely oblivious Courtney about new kinds of lowsodium wheatrice cake fresh fruits and New Age music particularly Manhattan Steamroller\\n   Its Aiwa Scotts saying Youvegotto hear it The sound he pauses closes his eyes in ecstasy chewing on corn bread  is fantastic\\n   Well you know Scottie the Aiwais okay Oh holy shitdream on Scottie Im thinking But Sansui is reallytopof the line I pause then add I should know I own one\\n   But I thoughtAiwawas top of the line Scott looks worried but not yet upset enough to please me\\n   No way Scott I say Does Aiwa have digital remote control\\n   Yeah he says\\n   Computer controls\\n   Uhhuh What a completq and totaldufus\\n   Does the system come with a turntable that has a metacrylate and brass platter\\n   Yes the bastard lies\\n   Does your system have an Accophase T tuner I ask him\\n   Sure he says shrugging\\n   Are you sure I say Think carefully\\n   Yeah I think so he says but his hand shakes as it reaches for more of the corn bread\\n   What kind of speakers\\n   Well Duntech wood he answers too quickly\\n   So solly dude Youve got to have the Infinity IRS V speakers I say Or\\n   Wait a minute he interrupts V speakers Ive never beard of V speakers\\n   See thats what I mean I say If you dont have the Vs you might as well be listening to a goddamn Walkman\\n   Whats the bass response on those speakers he asks suspiciously\\n   An ultralow fifteen hertz I purr enunciating each word\\n   That shuts him up for a minute Anne drones on about nonfat frozen yogurt and chow chows I sit back satisfied at having stumped Scott but too quickly he regains his composure and says Anyway trying to act blissfully uncaring that he owns a cheap shitty stereo  we bought the new Phil Collins today You should hear how great Groovy Kind of Love sounds on it\\n   Yeah I think its by far the best song hes written I say blah blah blah and though its finally something Scott and I can agree on the plates of blackened redfish appear and they look bizarre and Courtney excuses herself to the ladies room and after thirty minutes when she hasnt reappeared I wander into the back of the restaurant and find her asleep in the coatcheck room\\n   But at her apartment she lies naked on her back her legs tan and aerobicized and muscular and worked out  are spread and Im on my knees giving her head while jerking myself off and in the time since Ive started licking and sucking on her pussy shes already come twice and her cunt is tight and hot and wet and I keep it spread open fingering it with one hand keeping myself hard with the other I lift her ass up wanting to push my tongue into her but she doesnt want me to and so I raise up my head and reach over to the Portian antique nightstand for the condom that sits in the ashtray from Palio next to the halogen Tensor lamp and the DOro pottery urn and I tear the package open with two shiny slick fingers and my teeth then slip it easily onto my cock\\n   I want you to fuckme Courtney moans pulling her legs back spreading her vagina even wider fingering herself making me suck her fingers the nails on her hand long and red and the juice from her cunt glistening in the light coming from the streetlamps through the Stuart Hall venetian blinds tastes pink and sweet and she rubs it over my mouth and lips and tongue before it cools\\n   Yeah I say moving on top of her sliding my dick gracefully into her cunt kissing her on the mouth hard pushing into her with long fast strokes my cock my hips crazed moving on their own desirous momentum already my orgasm builds from the base of my balls my asshole coming up through my cock so stiff that it aches but then in midkiss I lift my head up leaving her tongue hanging out of her mouth starting to lick her own red swollen lips and while still humping but lightly now I realize there is a problem of sorts but I cannot think of what it is right now but then it hits me while Im staring at the halfempty bottle of Evian water on the nightstand and I gasp Oh shit and pull out\\n   What Courtney moans Did you forget something\\n   Without answering I get up from the futon and stumble into her bathroom trying to pull off the condom but it gets stuck halfway and while easing it off I accidentally trip over the Genold scale while also trying to flip on the light switch and in the process stubbing my big toe then cursing I manage to open the medicine cabinet\\n   Patrick what are youdoing she calls from the bedroom\\n   Im looking for the watersoluble spermicidal lubricant I call back What do you think Im doing Looking for anAdvil\\n   Oh my god she cries out You didnt haveanyon\\n   Courtney I call back noticing a small razor nick above my lip Whereis it\\n   Icannot hear you Patrick she calls out\\n   Luis has terrible taste in cologne I mutter picking up a bottle of Paco Rabanne sniffing it\\n   Whatareyou saying she cries out\\n   The watersoluble spermicidal lubricant I shout back staring into the mirror searching her counter for a Clinique TouchStick to put over the razor nick\\n   What do you meanwhere is it she calls out Didnt you have itwithyou\\n   Where is the goddamnwatersoluble spermicidal lubricant I scream Water Soluble Spermicidal Lubricant Im shouting this while using some of her Clinique coverup over the blemish then combing my hair back\\n   Top shelf she says I think\\n   While looking through the medicine cabinet I glance over at her tub noticing how plain it is which moves me to say You know Courtney you should really get your act together and get your tub marbleized or maybe add some Jacuzzi jets I call out Can you hear me Courtney\\n   After a long while she says Yes Patrick I hear you\\n   I finally find the tube behind a huge bottle ajar of Xanax on the top shelf of the medicine cabinet and before my dick totally softens place a small dab of it inside the tip of the condom slather it on the latex sheath and then walk back into the bedroom jumping onto the futon causing her to snap Patrick this is not a fuckingtrampoline Ignoring her I kneel over her body sliding my cock up into Courtney and immediately shes pushing her hips up to meet my thrusts then she licks her thumb and starts rubbing her clit I watch as my cock moves in then out then into her vagina with long fast strokes\\n   Wait she gasps\\n   What I moan puzzled but almost there\\n   Luis is a despicable twit she gasps trying to push me out of her\\n   Yes I say leaning on top of her tonguing her ear Luisis a despicable twit I hate him too and now spurred on by her disgust for her wimp boyfriend I start moving faster my climax approaching\\n   No you idiot she groans I saidIs it a receptacle tip Not Is Luis a despicable twit Is it areceptacle tipGet off me\\n   Is what awhat I moan\\n   Pull out she groans struggling\\n   Im ignoring you I say moving my mouth down on her small perfect nipples both of them stiff sitting on hard big tits\\n   Pull out goddamnit she screams\\n   What do you want Courtney I grunt slowing my thrusts down until I finally straighten up and then Im just kneeling over her my cock still half inside She hunches back against the headboard and my dick slides out\\n   Its a plain end I point I think\\n   Turn the light on she says trying to sit up\\n   Oh Jesus I say Im going home\\n   Patrick she warns Turnon the light\\n   I reach over and flip on the halogen Tensor\\n   Its a plain endsee I say So\\n   Take it off she says curtly\\n   Why I ask\\n   Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip she says covering her breasts with the Herms comforter her voice rising her patience shot to catch the forceof the ejaculate\\n   Im getting out of here I threaten but dont move Wheres your lithium\\n   She throws a pillow over her head and mumbles something retreating into a fetal position I think shes starting to cry\\n   Where is your lithium Courtney I calmly ask again Youmusttake some\\n   Something indecipherable is mumbled again and she shakes her head no no no  beneath the pillow\\n   WhatWhatdid you say I ask with forced politeness jerking myself feebly back to an erection Where Sobs beneath the pillow barely audible\\n   You are crying now and though it sounds clearer to me I stillcannothear a word youre saying I try to grab the pillow off her head Nowspeak up\\n   Again she mumbles again it doesnt make any sense\\n   Courtney I warn getting furious if you just said what I think you said that your lithium is in a carton in the freezer next to the Frusen Gldj and is asorbet Im screaming this  if this is really what you said then I willkillyou Is it asorbet Is your lithium really asorbet I scream finally pulling the pillow from her head and slapping her hard once across the face\\n   Do you think youre turning me on by havingunsafe sex she screams back\\n   Oh Christ this really isnt worth it I mutter pulling the condom dowp so there is half an inch to spare a little less actually And see Courtney its there for what Huh Tell us I slap her again this time lightly Why is it pulled down half an inch So it can catch theforce of the ejaculate\\n   Well itsnot a turnonfor me Shes hysterical racked with tears choking I have a promotion coming to me Im going to Barbados in August and I dont want a case of Kaposis sarcoma to fuck it up She chokes coughing Oh god I want to wear a bikini she wails A Norma Kamali I just bought at Bergdorfs\\n   I grab her head and force her to look at the placement of the condom See Happy You dumb bitch Are you happy you dumb bitch\\n   Without looking at my dick she sobs Oh god just get it over with and falls back down on the bed\\n   Roughly I push my cock back into her and bring myself to an orgasm so weak as to be almost nonexistent and my groan of a massive but somewhat expected disappointment is mistaken by Courtney for pleasure and momentarily spurs her on as she lies sobbing beneath me on the bed sniffling to reach down and touch herself but I start getting soft almost instantly actuallyduringthe moment I came but if I dont withdraw from her while still erect shell freak out so I hold on to the base of the condom as I literallywiltout of her After lying there on separate sides of the bed for what might be twenty minutes with Courtney whimpering about Luis and antique cutting boards and the sterling silver cheese grater and muffin tin she left at Harrys she then tries to give me head I want to fuck you again I tell her but I dont want to wear a condom because I dont feel anything and she says calmly taking her mouth off my limp shrunken dick glaring at me If you dont use one youre not going to feel anything anyway\\n   Business Meeting\\n   Jean my secretary who is in love with me walks into my office without buzzing announcing that I have a very important company meeting to attend at eleven Im sitting at the Palazzetti glasstop desk staring into my monitor with my RayBans on chewing Nuprin hung over from a coke binge that started innocently enough last night at Shout with Charles Hamilton Andrew Spencer and Chris Stafford and then moved on to the Princeton Club progressed to Barcadia and ended at Nells around threethirty and though earlier this morning while soaking in a bath sipping a Stoli Bloody Mary after maybe four hours of sweaty dreamless sleep I realized that therewasa meeting I seemed to have forgotten about it on the cab ride downtown Jean is wearing a red stretchsilk jacket a crocheted rayon ribbon skirt red suede pumps with satin bows by Susan Bennis Warren Edwards and goldplated earrings by Robert Lee Morris She stands there in front of me oblivious to my pain a file in her hand\\n   After pretending to ignore her for close to a minute I finally lower my sunglasses and clear my throat Yes Somethingelse Jean\\n   Mr Grouchy today She smiles placing the file timidly on my desk and stands there expecting me to  what amuse her with vignettes from last night\\n   Yes yousimpleton I am Mr Grouchy today I hiss grabbing the file and shoving it in the top desk drawer\\n   She stares at me uncomprehending then actually looking crestfallen says Ted Madison called and so did James Baker They want to meet you at Fluties at six\\n   I sigh glaring at her Well what should you do\\n   She laughs nervously standing there her eyes wide Im not sure\\n   Jean I stand up to lead her out of the office What do   you say\\n   It takes her a little while but finally frightened she guesses Just say no\\n   Just say no I nod pushing her out and slamming the door\\n   Before leaving my office for the meeting I take two Valium wash them down with a Perrier and then use a scruffing cleanser on my face with premoistened cotton balls afterwards applying a moisturizer Im wearing a wool tweed suit and a striped cotton shirt both by Yves Saint Laurent and a silk tie by Armani and new black captoed shoes by Ferragamo I Plax then brush my teeth and when I blow my nose thick ropy strings of blood and snot stain a fortyfivedollar handkerchief from Hermis that unfortunately wasnt a gift But Ive been drinking close to twenty liters of Evian water a day and going to the tanning salon regularly and one night of binging hasnt affected my skins smoothness or color tone My complexion is still excellent Three drops of Visine clear the eyes An ice pack tightens the skin All it comes down to is I feel like shit but look great\\n   Im also the first to make it to the boardroom Luis Carruthers follows like a puppy dog at my heels a close second and takes the seat next to mine which means Im supposed to take off my Walkman Hes wearing a wool plaid sports jacket wool slacks a Hugo Boss cotton shirt and paisley tie slacks Im guessing from Brooks Brothers He starts rattling on about a restaurant in Phoenix Propheteers that Im actually interested in hearing about but not from Luis Carruthers yet Im on ten milligrams of Valium and for that reason I can manage OnThe Patty Winters Show this morning were descendants of members of the Donner Party\\n   The clients weretotalhicks predictably Luis is saying They wanted to take me to a local production ofLes Miz which I alreadysawinLondon but\\n   Did you have any trouble getting reservations at Propheteers I ask cutting him off\\n   No None at all he says We ate late\\n   What did you order I ask\\n   I had the poached oysters the lotte and the walnut tart\\n   I hear the lotte is good there I murmur lost in thought\\n   The client had the boudin blanc the roasted chicken and the cheesecake he says\\n   Cheesecake I say confused by this plain aliensounding list What sauce or fruits were on the roasted chicken What shapes was it cut into\\n   None Patrick he says also confused It was roasted\\n   And the cheesecake what flavor Was it heated I say Ricotta cheesecake Goat cheese Were there flowers or cilantro in it\\n   It was just regular he says and then Patrick youre sweating\\n   What did she have I ask ignoring him The clients bimbo\\n   Well she had the country salad the scallops and the lemon tart Luis says\\n   The scallops were grilled Were they sashimi scallops In a ceviche of sorts Im asking Or were theygratinized\\n   No Patrick Luis says They were broiled\\n   Its silent in the boardroom as I contemplate this thinking it through before asking finally Whats broiled Luis\\n   Im not sure he says I think it involves a pan\\n   Wine I ask\\n   An  Sauvignon blanc he says Jordan Two bottles\\n   Car I ask Did you rent while in Phoenix\\n   BMW He smiles Little black beamer\\n   Hip I murmur remembering last night how I lost it completely in a stall at Nells my mouth foaming all I could think about were insects lots of insects and running at pigeons foaming at the mouth and running at pigeons Phoenix Janet Leigh was from Phoenix I stall then continue She got stabbed in the shower Disappointing scene I pause Blood looked fake\\n   Listen Patrick Luis says pressing his handkerchief into my hand my fingers clenched into a fist that relaxes at Luiss touch Dibble and I are having lunch next week at the Yale Club Would you like to join us\\n   Sure I think about Courtneys legs spread and wrapped around my face and when I look over at Luis in one brief flashing moment his head looks like a talking vagina and it scares the bejesus out of me moves me to say something while mopping the sweat off my brow Thats a nice suit Luis The farthest thing from my mind\\n   He looks down as if stunned and then blushing embarrassed he touches his own lapel Thanks Pat You look great too as usual And when he reaches out to touch my tie I catch his hand before his fingers make it telling him Your compliment was sufficient\\n   Reed Thompson walks in wearing a wool plaid fourbutton doublebreasted suit and a striped cotton shirt and a silk tie all Armani plus slightly tacky blue cotton socks by Interwoven and black Ferragamo captoe shoes that look exactly like mine with a copy of theWall Street Journalheld in a nicely manicured fist and a Bill Kaiserman tweed balmacaan overcoat draped casually across the other arm He nods and sits across from us at the table Soon after Todd Broderick walks in wearing a wool chalkstriped sixbutton doublebreasted suit and a striped broadcloth shirt and silk tie all by Polo plus an affected linen pocket square that Im fairly sure is also by Polo McDermott walks in next carrying a copy of this weeksNew Yorkmagazine and this morningsFinancial Timeswearing new nonprescription Oliver Peoples redwoodframed glasses a black and white wool houndstoothcheck singlebreasted suit with notch lapels a striped cotton dress shirt with spread collar and a silk paisley tie all of it designed and tailored by John Reyle\\n   I smile raising my eyebrows at McDermott who sullenly takes the seat next to mine He sighs and opens the newspaper silently

Obsession and Polo and Grey Flannel and even Antaeus mingle wafting into each other rising from the suits and into the air forming their own mixture a cold sickening perfume\\n   But Im not apologizing I warn McDermott\\n   You already have Bateman he says\\n   Paul Owen walks in wearing a cashmere onebutton sports jacket tropical wool flannel slacks a buttondown tabcollared shirt by

humming to himself starts to read an article on Olympic divers\\n   Hello Halberstam Owen says walking by\\n   Hello Owen I say admiring the way hes styled and slicked back his hair with a part so

X\\n   Greg McBride walks in and stops by my chair Did you watch theWinters Show this morning Riot Total riot and we give each other highfive before he takes a seat between Dibble and Lloyd God knows where they came from\\n   Kevin Forrest who walks in with Charles Murphy is saying My call waiting is busted Felicia screwed it up somehow Im not even paying attention to what theyre wearing But I find myself staring at Murphys vintage owl cuff links with blue crystal eyes\\n   Video Store then DAgostinos\\n   Im wandering around VideoVisions the video rental store near my apartment on the Upper West Side sipping from a can of Diet Pepsi the new Christopher Cross tape blaring from the earphones of my Sony Walkman After the office I played racquetball with Montgomery then had a shiatsu massage and met Jesse Lloyd Jamie Conway and Kevin Forrest for drinks at Rustys on Seventythird Street Tonight Im wearing a new wool topcoat by Ungaro Uomo Paris and carrying a Bottega Veneta briefcase and an umbrella by Georges Gaspar\\n   The video store is more crowded than usual There are too many couples in line for me to rentSheMale ReformatoryorGingers Cuntwithout some sense of awkwardness or discomfort plus Ive already bumped into Robert Ailes from First Boston in the Horror aisle or at least I think it was Robert Ailes He mumbled Hello McDonald as he passed me by holdingFriday the th Part  and a documentary on abortions in what I noticed were nicely manicured hands marred only by what looked to me like an imitationgold Rolex\\n   Since pornography seems out of the question I browse through Light Comedy and feeling ripped off settle for a Woody Allen movie but Im still not satisfied I want something else I pass through the Rock Musical section nothing  then find myself in Horror Comedy  ditto  and suddenly Im seized by a minor anxiety attackThere are too many fucking movies to choose from I duck behind a promotional cardboard display for the new Dan Aykroyd comedy and take two fivemilligram Valiums washing them down with the Diet Pepsi Then almost by rote as if Ive been programmed I reach forBody Double a movie I have rented thirtyseven times  and walk up to the counter where I wait for twenty minutes to be checked out by a dumpy girl five pounds overweight dry frizzy hair Shes actually wearing a baggy nondescript sweater  definitely not designer  probably to hide the fact thatshe has no tits and even though she has nice eyes so fucking what Finally its my turn I hand her the empty boxes\\n   Is this it she asks taking my membership card from me Im wearing Mario Valentino Persianblack gloves My VideoVisions membership costs only two hundred and fifty dollars annually\\n   Do you have any Jami Gertz movies I ask her trying to make direct eye contact\\n   What she asks distracted\\n   Any movies that Jami Gertz is in\\n   Who She enters something into the computer and then says without looking at me How many nights\\n   Three I say Dont you know who Jami Gertz is\\n   I dont think so She actually sighs\\n   JamiGertz I say Shes anactress\\n   I dont think I know who you mean she says in a tone that suggests Im harassing her but hey she works in a video rental store and since its such a demanding highpowered profession her bitchy behavior is completely reasonableright The things I could do to this girls body with a hammer the words I could carve into her with an ice pick She hands the guy behind her my boxes and I pretend to ignore his horrified reaction as he recognizes me after he looks at theBody Doublebox but he dutifully walks into some kind of vault in the back of the store to get the movies\\n   Yeah Sure you do I say goodnaturedly Shes in those Diet Coke commercials You know the ones\\n   I really dont think so she says in a monotone that almost cuts me off She types the names of the movies and then my membership number into the computer\\n   I like the part inBody Doublewhere the woman gets drilled by the power driller in the movie the best I say almost gasping It seems very hot in the video store right now all of a sudden and after murmuring oh my god under my breath I place a gloved hand on the counter to settle it from shaking And the blood starts pouring outof the ceiling I take a deep breath and while Im saying this my head starts nodding of its own accord and I keep swallowing thinkingI have to see her shoesand so as inconspicuously as possible I try to peer over the counter to check out what kind of shoes shes wearing but maddeningly theyre only sneakersnotKSwissnotTretornnotAdidasnotReebok just cheap ones\\n   Sign here She hands me the tapes without even looking at me refusing to recognize who I am and breathing in hard and exhaling she motions for the next in line a couple with a baby\\n   On the way back to my apartment I stop at DAgostinos where for dinner I buy two large bottles of Perrier a sixpack of Coke Classic a head of arugula five mediumsized kiwis a bottle of tarragon balsamic vinegar a tin of crme fraiche a carton of microwave tapas a box of tofu and a whitechocolate candy bar I pick up at the checkout counter\\n   Once outside ignoring the bum lounging below theLes Misrablesposter and holding a sign that reads IVE LOST MY JOB I AM HUNGRY I HAVE NO MONEY PLEASE HELP whose eyes tear after I pull the teasethebumwithadollar trick and tell him Jesus will you get a fucking shaveplease my eyes almost like they were guided by radar focus in on a red Lamborghini Countach parked at the curb gleaming beneath the streetlamps and I have to stop moving the Valium shockingly unexpectedly kicking in everything else becomes obliterated the crying bum the black kids on crack rapping along to the blaring beatbox the clouds of pigeons flying overhead looking for space to roost the ambulance sirens the honking taxis the decentlooking babe in the Betsey Johnson dress all of that fades and in what seems like timelapse photography but in slow motion like a movie the sun goes down the city gets darker and all I can see is the red Lamborghini and all I can hear is my own even steady panting Im still standing drooling in front of the store staring minutes later I dont know how many\\n   Facial\\n   I leave the office at fourthirty head up to Xclusive where I work out with free weights for an hour then taxi across the park to Gios in the Pierre Hotel for a facial a manicure and if time permits a pedicure Im lying on the elevated table in one of the private rooms waiting for Helga the skin technician to facialize me My Brooks Brothers shirt and Garrick Anderson suit hang in the closet my A Testoni loafers sit on the floor thirtydollar socks from Barneys balled up in them sixtydollar boxer shorts from Comme des Garons are the only article of clothing Im still wearing The smock Im supposed to have on is crumpled next to the shower stall since I want Helga to check my body out notice my chest see how fuckingbuffmy abdominals have gotten since the last time I was here even though shes much older than I am maybe thirty or thirtyfive  and theres no way Id ever fuck her Im sipping a Diet Pepsi that Mario the valet brought me with crushed ice in a glass on the side that I asked for but dont want\\n   I pick up todaysPostthat hangs from a Smithly Watson glass magazine rack and scan the gossip columns then my eye catches a story about recent sightings of these creatures that seem to be part bird part rodent essentially pigeons with the heads and tails of rats  found deep in the center of Harlem and now making their way steadily toward midtown A grainy photograph of one of these things accompanies the article but experts thePostassures us are fairly certain this new breed is a hoax As usual this fails to soothe my fear and it fills me with a nameless dread that someone out there has wasted the energy and time to think this up to fake a photograph and do a halfassed job at that the thing looks like a fucking Big Mac and send the photograph in to thePost then for thePost to decide to run the story meetings debates lastminute temptations to cancel the whole thing to print the photograph to have someone write about the photo and interview the experts finally to run this story on page three in todays edition and have it discussed over hundreds of thousands of lunches in the city this afternoon I close the paper and lie back exhausted\\n   The door to the private room opens and a girl I havent seen before walks in and through halfclosed eyes I can see that shes young Italian okaylooking She smiles sitting in a chair at my feet and begins the pedicure She switches off the ceiling light and except for strategically placed halogen bulbs shining down on my feet hands and face the room darkens making it impossible to tell what kind of body she has only that shes wearing gray suede and black leather buttoned ankle boots by Maud FrizonThe Patty Winters Showthis morning was about UFOs That Kill Helga arrives\\n   Ah Mr Bateman Helga says How are you\\n   Very good Helga I say flexing the muscles in my stomach and chest My eyes are closed so it looks casual as if the muscles are acting on their own accord and I cant help it But Helga drapes the smock gently across my heaving chest and buttons it up pretending to ignore the undulations beneath the tan clean skin\\n   Youre back so soon she says\\n   I was only here two days ago I say confused\\n   I know but She stalls washing her hands in the sink Never mind\\n   Helga I ask\\n   Yes Mr Bateman\\n   Walking in here I spotted a pair of mens goldtasseled loafers from Bergdorf Goodman waiting to be shined outside the door of the next room Who do they belong to I ask\\n   Thats Mr Erlanger she says\\n   Mr Erlanger from Lehmans\\n   No Mr Erlanger from Salomon Brothers she says\\n   Did I ever tell you that I want to wear a big yellow smileyface mask and then put on the CD version of Bobby McFerrins Dont Worry Be Happy and then take a girl and a dog a collie a chow a sharpei it doesnt really matter  and then hook up this transfusion pump this IV set and switch their blood you know pump the dogs blood into the hardbody and vice versa did I ever tell you this While Im speaking I can hear the girl working on my feet humming one of the songs fromLes Misrablesto herself and then Helga runs a moistened cotton ball across my nose leaning close to the face inspecting the pores I laugh maniacally then take a deep breath and touch my chest expecting a heart to be thumping quickly impatiently but theres nothing there not even a beat\\n   Shhh Mr Bateman Helga says running a warm loofah sponge over my face which stings then cools the skin Relax\\n   Okay I say Im relaxing\\n   Oh Mr Bateman Helga croons you have such a nice complexion How old are you May I ask\\n   Im twentysix\\n   Ah thats why Its so clean So smooth She sighs Just relax\\n   I drift my eyes rolling back into my head the Muzak version of Dont Worry Baby drowning out all bad thoughts and I start thinking only positive things the reservations I have tonight with Marcus Halberstams girlfriend Cecelia Wagner the mashed turnips at Union Square Caf skiing down Buttermilk Mountain in Aspen last Christmas the new Huey Lewis and the News compact disc dress shirts by Ike Behar by Joseph Abboud by Ralph Lauren beautiful oiled hardbodies eating each others pussies and assholes under harsh video lights truckloads of arugula and cilantro my tan line the way the muscles in my back look when the lights in my bathroom fall on them at the right angle Helgas hands caressing the smooth skin on my face lathering and spreading cream and lotions and tonics into it admiringly whispering Oh Mr Bateman your face is so clean and smooth so clean the fact that I dont live in a trailer park or work in a bowling alley or attend hockey games or eat barbecued ribs the look of the ATT building at midnight only at midnight Jeannie comes in and starts the manicure first clipping and filing the nails then brushing them with a sandpaper disk to smooth out the remaining edges\\n   Next time Id prefer them a bit longer Jeannie I warn her\\n   Silently she soaks them in warm lanolin cream then dries both hands off and uses a cuticle moisturizer then removes all the cuticles while cleaning under the nails with a cottononwood stick A heat vibrator massages the hand and forearm The nails are buffed first with chamois and then with bung lotion\\n   Date with Evelyn\\n   Evelyn comes in on the call waiting of my third line and I wasnt going to take it but since Im holding on the second line to find out if Bullock the matre d at the new Davis Franois restaurant on Central Park South has any cancellations for tonight so Courtney holding on the first line and I might have dinner I pick it up in the hope that its my dry cleaners But no its Evelyn and though it really isnt fair to Courtney I take her call I tell Evelyn Im on the other line with my private trainer I then tell Courtney I have to take Paul Owens call and that Ill see her at Turtles at eight and then I cut myself off from Bullock the matre d Evelyns staying at the Carlyle since the woman who lives in the brownstone next to hers was found murdered last night decapitated and this is why Evelyns all shook up She couldnt deal with the office today so she spent the afternoon calming herself with facials at Elizabeth Arden She demands that we have dinner tonight and then says before I can make up a plausible lie anacceptable excuse Where were you last nightPatrick\\n   I pause Why Where wereyou I ask while guzzling from a liter of Evian still slightly sweaty from this afternoons workout\\n   Arguing with the concierge at the Carlyle she says soundingratherpissed off Now tell me Patrick wherewereyou\\n   Why were you arguing with him Lask\\n   Patrick she says a declarative statement\\n   Im here I say after a minute\\n   Patrick It doesnt matter The phone in my room didnt have two lines and there wasno call waiting she says Wherewere you\\n   I was fooling around renting videotapes I say pleased giving myself highfive the cordless phone cradled in my neck\\n   I wanted to come over she says in a whiny littlegirl tone I was scared I still am Cant you hear it in my voice\\n   Actually you sound like anything but\\n   No Patrick seriously Im quite terrified she says Im shaking Just like a leaf Im shaking Ask Mia my facialistShesaid I was tense\\n   Well I say you couldnt have come over anyway\\n   Honey why not she whines and then addresses someone who just entered her suite Oh wheel it over there near the window nothatwindow and can you tell me where that damn masseuse is\\n   Because your neighbors head was in my freezer I yawn stretching Listen Dinner Where Can you hear me\\n   At eightthirty the two of us are sitting across from each other in Barcadia Evelyns wearing an Anne Klein rayon jacket a woolcrepe skirt a silk blouse from Bonwits antique gold and agate earrings from James Robinson that cost roughly four thousand dollars and Im wearing a doublebreasted suit a silk shirt with woven stripes a patterned silk tie and leather slipons all by Gianni Versace I neither canceled the reservation at Turtles nor told Courtney not to meet me there so shell probably show up around eightfifteen completely confused and if she hasnt taken any Elavil today shell probably be furious and its this fact not the bottle of Cristal that Evelyn insists on ordering and then adds cassis to  that I laugh out loud about\\n   I spent most of the afternoon buying myself early Christmas presents a large pair of scissors at a drugstore near City Hall a letter opener from Hammacher Schlemmer a cheese knife from Bloomingdales to go along with the cheese board that Jean my secretary whos in love with me left on my desk before she went to lunch while I was in a meetingThe Patty Winters Showthis morning was about the possibility of nuclear war and according to the panel of experts the odds are pretty good it will happen sometime within the next month Evelyns face seems chalky to me right now her mouth lined with a purple lipstick that gives off an almost startling effect and I realize that shes belatedly taken Tim Prices advice to stop using her tanning lotion Instead of mentioning this and have her bore me silly with inane denials I ask about Tims girlfriend Meredith whom Evelyn despises for reasons never made quite clear to me And because of rumors about Courtney and myself Courtneys also on Evelyns shit list for reasons that are a little clearer I place a hand over the top of the champagne flute when the apprehensive waitress at Evelyns request attempts to add some blueberry crisis into my Cristal\\n   No thank you I tell her Maybe later In a separate glass\\n   Party pooper Evelyn giggles then takes a sharp breath But you smell nice What are you wearing Obsession You party pooper is it Obsession\\n   No I say grimly Paul Sebastian\\n   Of course She smiles downs her second glass She seems in a much better mood boisterous almost more than youd expect of someone whose neighbors head was sliced off in a matter of seconds while she was still conscious by an electric minichain saw Evelyns eyes momentarily glitter in the candlelight then revert to their normal pallid gray\\n   HowisMeredith I ask trying to mask my void of disinterest\\n   Oh god Shes dating Richard Cunningham Evelyn moans Hes at First Boston If you canbelieveit\\n   You know I mention Tim was going to break it off with her Call it quits\\n   Why for gods sake Evelyn asks surprised intrigued They had thatfabulous place in the Hamptons\\n   I remember him telling me that he was sick to death of watching her do nothing but her nails all weekend\\n   Oh my god Evelyn says and then genuinely confused You mean wait she didnt have someone do them for her\\n   Tim said and he reiterated this fact quite often that she had all the personality of a gameshow host I say dryly sipping from the flute\\n   She smiles to herself secretly Tim is a rascal\\n   Idly I wonder if Evelyn would sleep with another woman if I brought one over to her brownstone and if I insisted whether theyd let me watch the two of them get it on If theyd let me direct tell them what to do position them under hot halogen lamps Probably not the odds dont look good But what if I forced her atgunpointThreatened to cut them both up maybe if they didnt comply The thought doesnt seem unappealing and I can imagine the whole scenario quite clearly I start counting the banquettes that encircle the room then I start counting the people sitting in the banquettes\\n   Shes asking me about Tim Where do you think that rascal has been Rumor is hes atSachs she says ominously\\n   Rumor is I say hes in rehab This champagne isnt cold enough Im distracted Doesnt he send you postcards\\n   Has he been sick she asks with the slightest trepidation\\n   Yes I think so I say I think thats what it is You know if you order a bottle of Cristal it should at least be you knowcold\\n   Oh my god Evelyn says You think he might besick\\n   Yes Hes in a hospital In Arizona I add The wordArizonahas a mysterious tinge to it and I say it again Arizona I think\\n   Oh mygod Evelyn exclaims now truly alarmed and she gulps down what little Cristal is left in her glass\\n   Who knows I manage the slightest of shrugs\\n   You dont think She breathes in and puts her glass down You dont think its  and now she looks around the restaurant before leaning in whispering  AIDS\\n   Oh no nothing like that I say though immediately I wish I had paused long enough before answering to scare her Just general brain  I bite the tip off an herbed breadstick and shrug  injuries\\n   Evelyn sighs relieved and then says Is it warm in here\\n   All I can think about is this poster I saw in the subway station the other night before I killed those two black kids a photo of a baby calf its head turned toward the camera its eyes caught wide and staring by the flash and its body seemed like it was boxed into some kind of crate and in big black letters below the photo it read Question Why Cant This Veal Calf Walk Then Answer Because It Only Has Two Legs But then I saw another one the same exact photo the same exact calf yet beneath it this one read Stay Out of Publishing  I pause still fingering the breadstick then ask Is any of this registering with you or would I get more of a response from oh an ice bucket I say all of this staring straight at Evelyn enunciating precisely trying to explain myself and she opens her mouth and I finally expect her to acknowledge my character And for the first time since Ive known her she is straining to say something interesting and I pay very close attention and she asks Is that\\n   Yes This is the only moment of the evening where I feel any genuine interest toward what she has to say and I urge her to go on Yes Is that \\n   Is that Ivana Trump she asks peering over my shoulder\\n   I whirl around Where Wheres Ivana\\n   In the booth near the front second in from Evelyn pauses  Brooke Astor See\\n   I squint put on my Oliver Peoples nonprescription glasses and realize that Evelyn her vision clouded by the cassisriddled Cristal not only has mistaken Norris Powell for Ivana Trump but has mistaken Steve Rubell for Brooke Astor and I cant help it I almost explode\\n   No oh mygod oh mygod Evelyn I moan crushed disappointed my adrenaline rush turning sour my head in my hands How could you mistake thatwenchfor Ivana\\n   Sorry I hear her chirp Girlish mistake\\n   That is infuriating I hiss both eyes clenched tight\\n   Our hardbody waitress who has on satin highbacked pumps sets down two new champagne flutes for the second bottle of Cristal Evelyn orders The waitress pouts her lips at me when I reach for another breadstick and I lift my head toward her and pout mine back then press my head again into the palms of my hands and this happens again when she brings our appetizers Dried peppers in a spicy pumpkin soup for me dried corn and jalapeo pudding for Evelyn Ive kept my hands over both ears trying to block out Evelyns voice during this whole interim between her mistaking Norris Powell for Ivana Trump and the arrival of our appetizers but now Im hungry so I tentatively remove my right hand from my ear Immediately the whine seems deafening\\n   Tandoori chicken and foie gras and lots of jazz and he adored the Savoy but shad roe the colors were gorgeous aloe shell citrus Morgan Stanley\\n   I clasp my hands back where they were pressing even tighter Once again hunger overtakes me and so humming loudly to myself I reach again for the spoon but its hopeless Evelyns voice is at a particular pitch that cannot be ignored\\n   Gregorys graduating from Saint Paul soon and will be attending Columbia in September Evelyn is saying carefully blowing on her pudding which by the way is served cold And Ivegotto get him a graduation present and Im at a total loss Suggestions hon\\n   A poster fromLes Misrables I sigh only half joldng\\n   Perfect she says blowing on the pudding again then after a sip of Cristal she makes a face\\n   Yes dear I ask spitting a pumpkin seed that arches throughthe air before gracefully hitting the dead center of the ashtray instead of Evelyns dress my original target Hmmm\\n   We need more cassis she says Will you get our waitress\\n   Of course we do I say goodnaturedly and still smiling I have no idea who Gregory is You do know that right\\n   Evelyn puts her spoon down delicately next to the plate of pudding and looks into my eyes Mr Bateman I really like you Iadoreyour sense of humor She gives my hand a soft squeeze and laughs actuallysaysHahaha but shes serious not joking Evelyn reallyis paying me a compliment Shedoesadmire my sense of humor Our appetizers are removed and at the same time our entres arrive so Evelyn has to take her hand off mine to make room for the plates She ordered quail stuffed into blue corn tortillas garnished with oysters in potato skins I have the freerange rabbit with Oregon morels and herbed french fries \\n   He went to Deerfield then Harvard She went to Hotchkiss then Radcliffe\\n   Evelyn is talking but Im not listening Her dialogue overlaps her own dialogue Her mouth is moving but Im not hearing anything and I cant listen I cant really concentrate since my rabbit has been cut to look just like   a star Shoestring french fries surround it and chunky red salsa has been smeared across the top of the plate  which is white and porcelain and two feet wide  to give the appearance of a sunset but it looks like one big gunshot wound to me and shaking my head slowly in disbelief I press a finger into the meat leaving the indentation of one finger then another and then I look for a napkin not my own to wipe my hand with Evelyn hasnt broken her monologue  she talks and chews exquisitely  and smiling seductively at her I reach under the table and grab her thigh wiping my hand off and still talking she smiles naughtily at me and dips more champagne I keep studying her face bored by how beautiful it is flawless really and I think to myself how strange it is that Evelyn has pulled me through so much how shes always been there when I needed her most I look back at the plate thoroughly unhungry pick up my fork study the plate hard for a minute or two whimper to myself before sighing and putting the fork down I pick up my champagne glass instead\\n   Groton Lawrenceville Milton Exeter Kent Saint Pauls Hotchkiss Andover Milton Choate oops already said Milton\\n   If Im not eating this tonight and Im not I want some cocaine I announce But I havent interrupted Evelyn shes unstoppable a machine  and she continues talking\\n   Jayne Simpsons wedding was so beautiful she sighs And the reception afterwards was wild Club Chernoble covered by Page Six Billy covered itWWD did a layout\\n   I heard there was a twodrink minimum I say warily signaling for a nearby busboy to remove my plate\\n   Weddings aresoromantic She had a diamond engagement ring Youknow Patrick Iwontsettle for less she says coyly Ithasto be diamond Her eyes glaze over and she tries to recount the wedding in mindnumbing detail It was a sitdown dinner for five hundred no excuse me seven hundred and fifty followed by a sixteenfoot tiered Ben and Jerrys ice cream cake The gown was by Ralph and it was white lace and lowcut and sleeveless It was darling Oh Patrick what would you wear she sighs\\n   I would demand to wear RayBan sunglasses Expensive RayBans I say carefully In fact I would demand that everyone would have to wear RayBan sunglasses\\n   Id want a zydeco band Patrick Thats what Id want A zydeco band she gushes breathlessly Or mariachi Or reggae Something ethnic to shock Daddy Oh Icantdecide\\n   Id want to bring a Harrison AK assault rifle to the ceremony  I say bored in a rush with a thirtyround magazine so after thoroughly blowing your fat mothers head off with it I could use it on that fag brother of yours And though personally I dont like to use anything the Soviets designed I dont know the Harrison somehow reminds me of Stopping confused inspecting yesterdays manicure I look back at Evelyn

excitedly Andwell hire someone to videotape it\\n   Or an AR Youd like it Evelyn its the most expensive of guns but worth every penny I wink at her But shes still talking she doesnt hear a word nothing registers She does not fully graspa wordIm saying My essence is eluding her She stops her onslaught and breathes in and looks at me in a way that can only be described as dewyeyed Touching my hand my Rolex she breathes in once more this time expectantly and says We should do it\\n   Im trying to catch a glimpse of our hardbody waitress shes bending over to pick up a dropped napkin Without looking back at Evelyn I ask Do what\\n   Get married she says blinking Have a wedding\\n   Evelyn\\n   Yes darling\\n   Is your kir spiked I ask\\n   We should do it she says softly Patrick\\n   Are you proposingto me I laugh trying to fathom this reasoning I take the champagne glass away from her and sniff its rim\\n   Patrick she asks waiting for my answer\\n   Jeez Evelyn I say stuck I dont know\\n   Whynot she asks petulantly Give meonegood reason we shouldnt\\n   Because trying to fuck you is like trying to Frenchkiss a very small and lively gerbil I tell her I dont know\\n   Yes she says And\\n   With braces I finish shrugging\\n   What are you going to do she asks Wait three years until youre thirty\\n   Fouryears I say glaring Its fouryears until Im thirty\\n   Four years Three years Threemonths Oh god whats the difference Youll still be an old man She takes her hand away from mine You know you wouldnt be saying this if youd been to Jayne Simpsons wedding Youd take one look at it and want to marry me immediately\\n   But Iwas at Jayne Simpsons wedding Evelyn love of my life I say I was seated next to Sukhreet Gabel Believe me I wasthere\\n   Youre impossible she whines Youre a party pooper\\n   Or maybe I didnt I wonder aloud Maybe I was it covered by MTV\\n   And their honeymoon was soromantic Two hours later they were on the Concorde To London Oh Claridges Evelyn

bored sipping bad champagne could it be nonvintage Bollinger from plastic flutes chewing on kiwi slices each topped with a dollop of chvre vaguely looking around to score some cocaine Instead of finding anyone who knows a dealer I bump into Courtney by the stairs Wearing a silk and cotton stretchtulle bodywrap with jeweled lace pants she seems tense and warns me to stay away from Luis She

whispers sadly to herself\\n   Listen Im leaving I say finishing the champagne Why dont you go dance with the receptacle tip\\n   Whereareyou going she asks gripping my arm\\n   Courtney I dont want to experience another one of your emotional outbursts I tell her Besides the canaps are shitty\\n   Whereareyou going she asks again Details Mr Bateman\\n   Why are youso concerned\\n   Because Id like to know she says Youre not going to Evelyns are you\\n   Maybe I lie\\n   Patrick she says Dont leave me here I dontwant you to go\\n   Ihaveto return some videos I lie again handing her my empty champagne glass just as another camera flashes somewhere I walk away\\n   The band segues into a rousing version of Life in the Fast Lane and I start looking around for hardbodies Charles Simpson or someone who looks remarkably like him slickedback hair suspenders Oliver Peoples glasses  shakes my hand shouts Hey Williams and tells me to meet a group of people with Alexandra Craig at Nells around midnight I give him a reassuring squeeze on the shoulder and tell him Ill be there\\n   Outside smoking a cigar contemplating the sky I spot Reed Thompson who emerges from the Puck Building with his entourage Jamie Conway Kevin Wynn Marcus Halberstam no babes  and invites me along to dinner and though I suspect they have drugs I have misgivings about spending the evening with them and decide not to trek up to that Salvadorian bistro especially since they dont have reservations and arent guaranteed a table I wave them off then cross Houston dodging other limos leaving the party and start moving uptown Walking along Broadway I stop at an automated teller where just for the hell of it I take out another hundred dollars feeling better having an even five hundred in my wallet\\n   I find myself walking through the antique district below Fourteenth Street My watch has stopped so Im not sure what time it is but probably tenthirty or so Black guys pass by offering crack or hustling tickets to a party at the Palladium I walk by a newsstand a dry cleaners a church a diner The streets are empty the only noise breaking up the silence is an occasional taxi cruising toward Union Square A couple of skinny faggots walk by while Im at a phone booth checking my messages staring at my reflection in an antique stores window One of them whistles at me the other laughs a high fey horrible sound A torn playbill fromLes Misrablestumbles down the cracked urinestained sidewalk A streetlamp burns out Someone in a JeanPaul Gaultier topcoat takes a piss in an alleyway Steam rises from below the streets billowing up in tendrils evaporating Bags of frozen garbage line the curbs The moon pale and low hangs just above the tip of the Chrysler Building Somewhere from over in the West Village the siren from an ambulance screams the wind picks it up it echoes then fades\\n   The bum a black man lies in the doorway of an abandoned antique store on Twelfth Street on top of an open grate surrounded by bags of garbage and a shopping cart from Gristedes loaded with what I suppose are personal belongings newspapers bottles aluminum cans A handpainted cardboard sign attached to the front of the cart reads I AM HUNGRY AND HOMELESS PLEASE HELP ME A dog a small mutt shorthaired and rail thin lies next to him its makeshift leash tied to the handle of the grocery cart I dont notice the dog the first time I pass by Its only after I circle the block and come back that I see it lying on a pile of newspapers guarding the bum a collar around its neck with an oversize nameplate that reads GIZMO The dog looks up at me wagging its skinny pathetic excuse for a tail and when I hold out a gloved hand it licks at it hungrily The stench of some kind of cheap alcohol mixed with excrement hangs here like a heavy invisible cloud and I have to hold my breath before adjusting to the stink The bum wakes up opens his eyes yawning exposing remarkably stained teeth between cracked purple lips\\n   Hes fortyish heavyset and when he attempts to sit up I can make out his features more clearly in the glare of the streetlamp a few days growth of beard triple chin a ruddy nose lined with thick brown veins Hes dressed in some kind of tackylooking lime green polyester pantsuit with washedout Sergio Valente jeans wornoverit this seasons homeless persons fashion statement along with a ripped orange and brown Vneck sweater stained with what looks like burgundy wine It seems hes very drunk either that or hes crazy or stupid His eyes cant even focus when I stand over him blocking out the light from a streetlamp covering him in shadow I kneel down\\n   Hello I say offering thy hand the one the dog licked Pat Baternan\\n   The bum stares at me panting with the exertion it takes to sit up He doesnt shake my hand\\n   You want some money I ask gently Some food\\n   The bum nods and starts to cry thankfully\\n   I reach into my pocket and pull out a tendollar bill then change my mind and hold out a five instead Is this what you need\\n   The bum nods again and looks away shamefully his nose running and after clearing his throat says quietly Im so hungry\\n   Its cold out too I say Isnt it\\n   Im so hungry He convulses once twice a third time then looks away embarrassed\\n   Why dont you get a job I ask the bill still held in my hand but not within the bums reach If youre so hungry why dont you get a job\\n   He breathes in shivering and between sobs admits I lost my job\\n   Why I ask genuinely interested Were you drinking Is that why you lost it Insider trading just joking No really were you drinking on the job\\n   He hugs himself between sobs chokes I was fired I was laid off\\n   I take this in nodding Gee uh thats too bad\\n   Im so hungry he says then starts crying hard still holding himself His dog the thing called Gizmo starts whimpering\\n   Why dont you get another one I ask Why dont you get another job\\n   Im not He coughs holding himself shaking miserably violently unable to finish the sentence\\n   Youre not what I ask softly Qualified for anything else\\n   Tm hungry he whispers\\n   I know that I know that I say Jeez youre like a broken record Im trying to help you My impatience rises\\n   Im hungry he repeats\\n   Listen Do you think its fair to take money from people whodohave jobs Whodowork\\n   His face crumples and he gasps his voice raspy What am I gonna do\\n   Listen I say Whats your name\\n   Al he says\\n   Speak up I tell him Come on\\n   Al he says a little louder\\n   Get a goddamn job Al I say earnestly Youve got a negative attitude Thats whats stopping you Youve got to get your act together Ill help you\\n   Youre so kind mister Youre kind Youre a kind man he blubbers I can tell\\n   Shhh I whisper Its okay I start petting the dog\\n   Please he says grabbing for my wrist I dont know what to do Im so cold\\n   Do you know how bad you smell I whisper this soothingly stroking his face Thestenchmy god\\n   I cant He chokes then swallows I cant find a shelter\\n   Youreek I tell him Youreekofshit Im still petting the dog its eyes wide and wet and grateful Do you know that Goddamnit Al look at me and stop crying like some kind offaggot I shout My rage builds subsides and I close my eyesbringing my hand up to squeeze the bridge of my nose then I sigh Al Im sorry Its just that I dont know I dont have anything in common with you\\n   The bums not listening Hes crying so hard hes incapable of a coherent answer I put the bill slowly back into the pocket of my Luciano Soprani jacket and with the other hand stop petting the dog and reach into the other pocket The bum stops sobbing abruptly and sits up looking for the fiver or I presume his bottle of Thunderbird I reach out and touch his face gently once more with compassion and whisper Do you know what a fucking loser you are He starts nodding helplessly and I pull out a long thin knife with a serrated edge and being very careful not to kill him push maybe half an inch of the blade into his right eye flicking the handle up instantly popping the retina\\n   The bum is too surprised to say anything He only opens his mouth in shock and moves a grubby mittened hand slowly up to his face I yank his pants down and in the passing headlights of a taxi can make out his flabby black thighs rashed because of his constantly urinating in the pantsuit The stench of shit rises quickly into my face and breathing through my mouth down on my haunches I start stabbing him in the stomach lightly above the dense matted patch of pubic hair This sobers him up somewhat and instinctively he tries to cover himself with his hands and the dog starts yipping really furiously but it doesnt attack and I keep stabbing at the bum now between his fingers stabbing the backs of his hands His eye burst open hangs out of its socket and runs down his face and he keeps blinking which causes whats left of it inside the wound to pour out like red veiny egg yolk I grab his head with one hand and push it back and then with my thumb and forefinger hold the other eye open and bring the knife up and push the tip of it into the socket first breaking its protective film so the socket fills with blood then slitting the eyeball open sideways and he finally starts screaming once I slit his nose in two lightly spraying me and the dog with blood Gizmo blinking to get the blood out of his eyes I quickly wipe the blade clean across the bums face breaking open the muscle above his cheek Still kneeling I throw a quarter in his face which is slick and shiny with blood both sockets hollowed out and filled with gore whats left of his eyes literally oozing over his screaming lips in thick webby strands Calmly I whisper Theres a quarter Go buy somegum you crazy fuckingnigger Then I turn to the barking dog and when I get up stomp on its front legs while its crouched down ready to jump at me its fangs bared immediately shattering the bones in both its legs and it falls on its side squealing in pain front paws sticking up in the air at an obscene satisfying angle I cant help but start laughing and I linger at the scene amused by this tableau When I spot an approaching taxi I slowly walk away\\n   Afterwards two blocks west I feel heady ravenous pumped up as if Id just worked out and endorphins are flooding my nervous system or just embraced that first line of cocaine inhaled the first puff of a fine cigar sipped that first glass of Cristal Im starving and need something to eat but I dont want to stop by Nells though Im within walling distance and Indochine seems an unlikely place for a celebratory drink So I decide to go somewhere Al would go the McDonalds in Union Square Standing in the line I order a vanilla milk shake Extrathick I warn the guy who just shakes his head and flips on a machine and take it to a table up front where Al would probably sit my jacket and its sleeves lightly spattered with flecks of his blood Two waitresses from the Cat Club walk in after me and sit in the booth across from mine both smiling flirtatiously I play it cool and ignore them An old crazy woman wrinkled chainsmoking sits near us nodding at no one A police car passes by and after two more milk shakes my high slowly dissolves its intensity diminishing I grow bored tired the evening seems horribly anticlimactic and I start cursing myself for not going to that Salvadorian bistro with Reed Thompson and the guys The two girls linger still interested I check my watch One of the Mexicans working behind the counter stares at me while smoking a cigarette and he studies the stains on the Soprani jacket in a way that suggests hes going to say something about it but a customer comes in one of the black guys who tried to sell me crack earlier and he has to take the black guys order So the Mexican puts out his cigarette and thats what he does\\n   Genesis\\n   p\\n   Ive been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their  albumDukeBefore that I didnt really understand any of their work though on their last album of the s the conceptladenAnd Then There Were Threea reference to band member Peter Gabriel who left the group to start a lame solo career I did enjoy the lovely Follow You Follow Me Otherwise all the albums beforeDukeseemed too artsy too intelleotual It wasDukeAtlantic  where Phil Collins presence became more apparent and the music got more modern the drum machine became more prevalent and the lyrics started getting less mystical and more specific maybe because of Peter Gabriels departure and complex ambiguous studies of loss became instead smashing firstrate pop songs that I gratefully embraced The songs themselves seemed arranged more around Collins drumming than Mike Rutherfords bass lines or Tony Banks keyboard riffs A classic example of this is Misunderstanding which not only was the groups first big hit of the eighties but also seemed to set the tone for the rest of theiralbums as the decade progressed The other standout onDukeis Turn It On Again which is about the negative effects of television On the other hand Heathaze is a song I just dont understand while Please Dont Ask is a touching love song written to a separated wife who regains custody of the couples child Has the negative aspect of divorce ever been rendered in more intimate terms by a rock n roll group I dont think so Duke Travels and Dukes End might mean something but since the lyrics arent printed its hard to tell what Collins is singing about though thereiscomplex gorgeous piano work by Tony Banks on the latter track The only bummer aboutDukeis Alone Tonight which is way too reminiscent of Tonight Tonight Tonight from the groups later masterpieceInvisible Touchand the only example really of where Collins has plagiarized himself\\n   AbacabAtlantic  was released almost immediately afterDukeand it benefits from a new producer Hugh Padgham who gives the band a more eighties sound and though the songs seem fairly generic there are still great bits throughout the extended jam in the middle of the title track and the horns by some group called Earth Wind and Fire on No Reply at All are just two examples Again the songs reflect dark emotions and are about people who feel lost or who are in conflict but the production and sound are gleaming and upbeat even if the titles arent No Reply at All Keep It Dark Who Dunnit Like It or Not Mike Rutherfords bass is obscured somewhat in the mix but otherwise the band sounds tight and is once again propelled by Collins truly amazing drumming Even at its most despairing like the song Dodo about extinctionAbacabmusically is poppy and lighthearted\\n   My favorite track is Man on the Corner which is the only song credited solely to Collins a moving ballad with a pretty synthesized melody plus a riveting drum machine in the background Though it could easily come off any of Phils solo albums because the themes of loneliness paranoia and alienation are overly familiar to Genesis it evokes the bands hopeful humanism Man on the Corner profoundly equates a relationship with a solitary figure a bum perhaps a poor homeless person that lonely man on the corner who just stands around Who Dunnit profoundly expresses the theme of confusion against a funky groove and what makes this song so exciting is that it ends with its narrator never finding anything out at all\\n   Hugh Padgham produced next an even less conceptual effort simply calledGenesisAtlantic  and though its a fine album a lot of it now seems too derivative for my tastes Thats All sounds like Misunderstanding Taking It All Too Hard reminds me of Throwing It All Away It also seems less jazzy than its predecessors and more of an eighties pop album more rock n roll Padgham does a brilliant job of producing but the material is weaker than usual and you can sense the strain It opens with the autobiographical Mama thats both strange and touching though I couldnt tell if the singer was talking about his actual mother or to a girl he likes to call Mama Thats All is a lovers lament about being ignored and beaten down by an unreceptive partner despite the despairing tone its got a bright singalong melody that makes the song less depressing than it probably needed to be Thats All is the best tune on the album but Phils voice is strongest on House by the Sea whose lyrics are however too streamofconsciousness to make much sense It might be about growing up and accepting adulthood but its unclear at any rate its second instrumental part puts the song more in focus for me and Mike Banks gets to show off his virtuosic guitar skills while Tom Rutherford washes the tracks over with dreamy synthesizers and when Phil repeats the songs third verse at the end it can give you chills\\n   Illegal Alien is the most explicitly political song the group has yet recorded and their funniest The subject is supposed to be sad a wetback trying to get across the border into the United States  but the details are highly comical the bottle of tequila the Mexican holds the new pair of shoes hes wearing probably stolen and it all seems totally accurate Phil sings it in a brash whiny pseudoMexican voice that makes it even funnier and the rhyme of fun with illegal alien is inspired Just a Job to Do is the albums funkiest song with a killer bass line by Banks and though it seems to be about a detective chasing a criminal I think it could also be about a jealous lover tracking someone down Silver Rainbow is the albums most lyrical song The words are intense complex and gorgeous The album ends on a positive upbeat note with Its Gonna Get Better Even if the lyrics seem a tiny bit generic to some Phils voice is so confident heavily influenced by Peter Gabriel who never made an album this polished and heartfelt himself that he makes us believe in glorious possibilities\\n   Invisible TouchAtlantic  is the groups undisputed masterpiece Its an epic meditation on intangibility at the same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums It has a resonance that keeps coming back at the listener and the music is so beautiful that its almost impossible to shake off because every song makes some connection about the unknown or the spaces between people Invisible Touch questioning authoritative control whether by domineering lovers or by government Land of Confusion or by meaningless repetition Tonight Tonight Tonight All in all it ranks with the finest rock n roll achievements of the decade and the mastermind behind this album along of course with the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks Collins and Rutherford is Hugh Padgham who has never found as clear and crisp and modern a sound as this You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument\\n   In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer songwriting skills this album hits a new peak of professionalism Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion in which a singer addresses the problem of abusive political authority This is laid down with a groove funkier and blacker than anything Prince or Michael Jackson or any other black artist of recent years for that matter  has come up with Yet as danceable as the album is it also has a strippeddown urgency that not even the overrated Bruce Springsteen can equal As an observer of loves failings Collins beats out the Boss again and again reaching new heights of emotional honesty on In Too Deep yet it also showcases Collins clowny prankish unpredictable side Its the most moving pop song of the s about monogamy and commitment Anything She Does which echoes the J Geils Bands Centerfold but is more spirited and energetic starts off side two and after that the album reaches its peak with Domino a twopart song Part one In the Heat of the Night is full of sharp finely drawn images of despair and its paired with The Last Domino which fights it with an expression of hope This song is extremely uplifting The lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything Ive heard in rock\\n   Phil Collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way especiallyNo Jacket Requiredand songs like In the Air Tonight and Against All Odds though that song was overshadowed by the masterful movie from which it came and Take Me Home and Sussudio great great song a personal favorite and his remake of You Cant Hurry Love which Im not alone in thinking is better than the Supremes original But I also think that Phil Collins works better within the confines of the group than as a solo artist and I stress the wordartistIn fact it applies to all three of the guys because Genesis is still the best most exciting band to come out of England in the s\\n   Lunch\\n   Im sitting in DuPlex the new Tony McManus restaurant in Tribeca with Christopher Armstrong who also works at P P We went to Exeter together then he went to the University of Pennsylvania and Wharton before moving to Manhattan We inexplicably could not get reservations at Subjects so Armstrong suggested this place Armstrong is wearing a fourbutton doublebreasted chalkstriped spreadcollar cotton shirt by Christian Dior and a large paisleypatterned silk tie by Givenchy Gentleman His leather agenda and leather envelope both by Bottega Veneta lie on the third chair at our table a good one up front by the window Im wearing a nailheadpatterned worsted wool suit with overplaid from DeRigueur by Schoeneman a cotton broadcloth shirt by Bill Blass a Macclesfield silk tie by Savoy and a cotton handkerchief by Ashear Bros A Muzak rendition of the score fromLes Misrablesplays lightly throughout the restaurant Armstrongs girlfriend is Jody Stafford who used to date Todd Hamlin and this fact plus the TV monitors hanging from the ceilings with closedcircuit video of chefs working in the kitchen fills me with nameless dread Armstrong just got back from the islands and has a very deep very even tan but so do I\\n   So how were the Bahamas I ask after we order You just got back right\\n   Well Taylor Armstrong begins staring at a point somewhere behind me and slightly above my head on the column that has been terracottaized or perhaps on the exposed pipe that runs the length of the ceiling Travelers looking for that perfect vacation this summer may do well to look south as far south as the Bahamas and the Caribbean islands There are at least five smart reasons for visiting the Caribbean including the weather and the festivals and events the less crowded hotels and attractions the price and the unique cultures While many vacationers leave the cities in search of cooler climates during the summer months few have realized that the Caribbean has a yearround climate of seventyfive to eightyfive degrees and that the islands are constantly cooled by the trade winds It is frequently hotter north in\\n   OnThe Patty Winters Showthis morning the topic was ToddlerMurderers In the studio audience were parents of children whod been kidnapped tortured and murdered while on stage a panel of psychiatrists and pediatricians were trying to help themcope somewhat futilely I might add and much to my delight  with their confusion and anger But what really cracked me up was  via satellite on a lone TV monitor  three convicted ToddlerMurderers on death row who due to fairly complicated legal loopholes were now seeking parole and would probably get it But something kept distracting me while I watched the huge Sony TV over a breakfast of sliced kiwi and Japanese applepear Evian water oatbran muffins soy milk and cinnamon granola ruining my enjoyment of the grieving mothers and it wasnt until the show was almost over that I figured out what it was the crack above my David Onica that I had asked the doorman to tell the superintendent to fix On my way out this morning I stopped at the front desk about to complain to the doorman when I was confronted with anewdoorman my age but balding and homely andfatThree glazed jelly doughnutsandtwo steaming cups of extradarkhot chocolatelay on the desk in front of him beside a copy of thePostopened to the comics and it struck me that I was infinitely betterlooking more successful and richer than this poor bastard would ever be and so with a passing rush of sympathy I smiled and nodded a curt though not impolite good morning without lodging a complaint Oh really I find myself saying loudly completely uninterested to Armstrong\\n   Like the United States it celebrates the summer months with festivals and special events including music concerts art exhibits street fairs and sporting tournaments and because of the vast number of people traveling elsewhere the islands are less crowded allowing for better service and no lines when waiting to use that sailboat or dine in that restaurant I mean I think most people go to sample the culture the food the history\\n   On the way to Wall Street this morning due to gridlock I had to get out of the company car and was walking down Fifth Avenue to find a subway station when I passed what I thought was a Halloween parade which was disorienting since I was fairly sure this was May When I stopped on the corner of Sixteenth Street and made a closer inspection it turned out to be something called a Gay Pride Parade which made my stomach turn Homosexuals proudly marched down Fifth Avenue pink triangles emblazoned on pastelcolored windbreakers some even holding hands most singing Somewhere out of key and in unison I stood in front of Paul Smith and watched with a certain traumatized fascination my mind reeling with the concept that a human being amancould feel pride over sodomizing another man but when I began to receive fey catcalls from aging overmuscled beachboys with walruslike mustaches in between the linesTheres a place for us Somewhere a place for usI sprinted over to Sixth Avenue decided to be late for the office and took a cab back to my apartment where I put on a new suit by Cerruti  gave myself a pedicure and tortured to death a small dog I had bought earlier this week in a pet store on Lexington Armstrong drones on\\n   Water sports are of course the leading attraction But golf courses and tennis courts are in excellent condition and the pros at many of the resorts are made more available during the summer Many of the courts are lit for night playing as well\\n   Fuck yourself Armstrong Im thinking while staring out the window at the gridlock and pacing bums on Church Street Appetizers arrive sundriedtomato brioche for Armstrong Poblano chilies with an oniony orangepurple marmalade on the side for me I hope Armstrong doesnt want to pay because Ineed to show the dimwitted bastard that I in factdoown a platinum American Express card I feel very sad at this moment for some reason listening to Armstrong and a lump forms in my throat but I swallow and take a sip from my Corona and the emotion passes and during a pause while hes chewing I ask The food Hows the food almost involuntarily thinking about anything but\\n   Good question As for dining out the Caribbean has become more attractive as the island cuisine has mixed well with the European culture Many of the restaurants are owned and managed by Americans British French Italian even Dutch expatriates  Mercifully he pauses taking a bite out of his brioche which looks like a sponge drenched in bloodhis brioche looks like a big bloody sponge and he washes it down with a sip from his Corona My turn\\n   How about sightseeing I ask disinterestedly concentrating on the blackened chilies the yellowish marmalade circling the plate in an artful octagon cilantro leaves circling the marmalade chili seeds circling the cilantro leaves\\n   Sightseeing is highlighted by the European culture which established many of the islands as regional fortresses in the seventeen hundreds Visitors can see the various spots where Columbus landed and as we near the three hundredth anniversary of his first sailing in  there is a heightened awareness in the islands as to the history and culture that is an integral part of island life\\n   Armstrong you are an assholeUhhuh I nod Well Paisley ties plaid suits my aerobics class returning videotapes spices to pick up from Zabars beggars whitechocolate truffles The sickening scent of Drakkar Noir which is what Christopher is wearing floats over near my face mingling with the scent of the marmalade and cilantro the onions and the blackened chilies Uhhuh I say repeat\\n   And for the active vacationer there is mountain climbing cave exploring sailing horseback riding and whitewater river rafting and for the gamblers there are casinos on many of the islands\\n   Fleetingly I imagine pulling out my knife slicing a wrist one of mine aiming the spurting vein at Armstrongs head or better yet his suit wondering if he would still continue to talk I consider getting up without excusing myself taking a cab to another restaurant somewhere in SoHo maybe farther uptown having a drink using the rest room maybe even making a phone call to Evelyn coming back to Duplex and every molecule that makes up my body tells me that Armstrong would still be talking about not only his vacation but what seems like the worlds vacation in the fucking Bahamas Somewhere along the line the waiter removes halfeaten appetizers brings fresh Coronas freerange chicken with raspberry vinegar and guacamole calfs liver with shad roe and leeks and though Im not sure who ordered what it doesnt really matter since both plates look exactly the same I end up with the freerange chicken with extra tomatillo sauce I think\\n   Visitors to the Caribbean dont need a passport just proof of US citizenship  and even better Taylor is thatlanguageis no barrier English is spokeneverywhereeven on those islands where the local language is French or Spanish Most of the islands are former British\\n   My life is a living hell I mention off the cuff while casually moving leeks around on my plate which by the way is a porcelain triangle And there are many more people I uh want to want to well I guessmurder I say this emphasizing the last word staring straight into Armstrongs face\\n   Service has improved to the islands as both American Airlines and Eastern Airlines have created hubs in San Juan where they have set up connecting flights to those islands they dont serve with direct flights With additional service from BWIA Pan Am ALM Air Jamaica Bahamas Air and Cayman Airways most islands are easy to reach There are additional connections within the islands from LIAT and BWIA which provide a series of scheduled islandhopping flights\\n   Someone who I think is Charles Fletcher walks over while Armstrong keeps talking and he pats me on the shoulder and says Hey Simpson and See you at Fluties and then at the door meets up with a very attractive woman big tits blond tight dress not his secretary not his wife  and they leave Duplex together in a black limousine Armstrong is still eating cutting into the perfectly square slices of calfs liver and he keeps talking while I become increasingly mournful\\n   Vacationers who cant take a full week away will find the Caribbean an ideal spot for the alternative weekend escape Eastern Airlines has created its Weekender Club which includes many Caribbean destinations and enables members to visit many places at sharply reduced prices which I know doesnt matter but I still think people are going\\n   Concert\\n   Everyone is very uptight at the concert Carruthers drags us to in New Jersey this evening an Irish band called U who were on the cover ofTimemagazine last week The tickets were originally for a group of Japanese clients who canceled their trip to New York at the last minute making it virtually impossible for Carruthers or so he says to sell these frontrow seats So its Carruthers and Courtney Paul Owen and Ashley Cromwell and Evelyn and myself Earlier when I found out that Paul Owen was coming I tried to call Cecilia Wagner Marcus Halberstams girlfriend since Paul Owen seems fairly sure that Im Marcus and though she was flattered by my invitation I always suspected I was one of her crushes she had to attend a blacktie party for the opening of the new British musicalMaggieBut she did mention something about lunch next week and I told her I would give her a call on Thursday I was supposed to have dinner with Evelyn tonight but the thought of sitting alone with her during a twohour meal fills me with a nameless dread and so I call and reluctantly explain the schedule changes and she asks if Tim Price is coming and when I tell her no there is the briefest hesitation before she accepts and then I cancel the reservation Jean made for us at H the new Clive Powell restaurant in Chelsea and leave the office early for a quick aerobics class before the concert\\n   None of the girls are particularly excited about seeing the band and all have confided in me separately that they dont want to be here and in the limousine heading toward somewhere called the Meadowlands Carruthers keeps trying to placate everyone by telling us that Donald Trump is a big U fan and then even more desperately that John Gutfreund also buys their records A bottle of Cristal is opened then another The TV is tuned to a press conference Reagans giving but theres a lot of static and no one pays attention except for meThe Patty Winters Showthis morning was about Shark Attack Victims Paul Owen has called me Marcus four times and Evelyn much to my relief Cecilia twice but Evelyn doesnt notice since shes been glaring at Courtney the entire time weve been in the limousine Anyway no one has corrected Owen and its unlikely that anyone will I even called her Cecilia a couple of times myself when I was sure she wasnt listening while she was staring hatefully at Courtney Carruthers keeps telling me how nice I look and complimenting my suit\\n   Evelyn and I are by far the bestdressed couple Im wearing a lambs wool topcoat a wool jacket with wool flannel trousers a cotton shirt a cashmere Vneck sweater and a silk tie all from Armani Evelyns wearing a cotton blouse by Dolce do Gabbana suede shoes by Yves Saint Laurent a stenciled calf skirt by Adrienne Landau with a suede belt by Jill Stuart Calvin Klein tights Venetianglass earrings by Frances Patiky Stein and clasped in her hand is a single white rose that I bought at a Korean deli before Carruthers limousine picked me up Carruthers is wearing a lambs wool sport coat a cashmerevicua cardigan sweater cavalry twill trousers a cotton shirt and a silk tie all from Herms How tacky Evelyn whispered to me I silently agreed Courtney is wearing a triplelayered silk organdy top and a long velvet skirt with a fishtail hem velvetribbon and enamel earrings by Jos and Maria Barrera gloves by Portolano and shoes from Gucci Paul and Ashley are I think a bitoverdressed and she has sunglasses on even though the windows in the limo are tinted and its already dusk She holds a small bouquet of flowers daisies Carruthers gave her which failed to make Courtney jealous since she seems intent upon clawing Evelyns face open which right now though its the betterlooking face seems not a bad idea and one I wouldnt mind watching Courtney carry out Courtney has aslightly better body Evelyn nicer tits\\n   The concert has been dragging on now for maybe twenty minutes I hate live music but everyone around us is standing their screams of approval competing with the racket coming from the towering walls of speakers stacked over us The only real pleasure I get from being here is seeing Scott and Anne Smiley ten rows behind us in shittier though probably not less expensive seats Carruthers changes seats with Evelyn to discuss business with me but I cant hear a word so I change seats with Evelyn to talk to Courtney\\n   Luis is aweasel I shout He suspects nothing\\n   The Edge is wearing Armani she shouts pointing at the bassist\\n   ThatsnotArmani I shout back Its Emporio\\n   No she shouts Armani\\n   The grays are too muted and so are the taupes and navies Definite winged lapels subtle plaids polka dots and stripes are ArmaniNotEmporio  I shout extremely irritated that she doesnt know this cant differentiate both my hands covering both ears Theres a difference Which ones The Ledge\\n   The drummer might be The Ledge she shouts I think Im not sure I need a cigarette Where were you the other night If you tell me with Evelyn Im going to hit you\\n   The drummer is not wearing anything by Armani I scream Or Emporio for that matter Nowhere\\n   I dont know which one the drummer is she shouts\\n   Ask Ashley I suggest screaming\\n   Ashley she screams reaching over across Paul and tapping Ashleys leg Which ones The Ledge Ashley shouts something at her that I cant hear and then Courtney turns back to me shrugging She said she cant believe shes in New Jersey\\n   Carruthers motions for Courtney to change seats with him She waves the little twit away and grips my thigh which I flex rockhard and her hand lingers admiringly But Luis persists and she gets up and screams at me I think we need drugs tonight I nod The lead singer Bono is screeching out what sounds like Where the Beat Sounds the Same Evelyn and Ashley leave to buy cigarettes use the ladies room find refreshments Luis sits next to me\\n   The girls are bored Luis screams at me\\n   Courtney wants us to find her some cocaine tonight I shout\\n   Ohgreat Luis looks sulky\\n   Do we have reservations anywhere\\n   Brussels he shouts checking his Rolex But itsdoubtfulif well make it\\n   If wedont make it I warn him Im not goinganywhere else You can drop me at my apartment\\n   Wellmakeit he shouts\\n   If wedont what about Japanese I suggest relenting Theres a really top sushi bar on the Upper West Side Blades Chef used to be at Loito It got agreat rating in Zagat\\n   Bateman Ihatethe Japanese Carruthers screams at me one hand placed over an ear Little slantyeyed bastards\\n   What I scream in the hell are you talking about\\n   Oh I know I know he screams eyes bulging They save more than we do and they dont innovate much but they sure in the fuck know how to takesteal our innovations improve on them then ram them down our fucking throats\\n   I stare at him disbelieving for a moment then look at the stage at the guitarist running around in circles Bonos arms outstretched as he runs back and forth across the length of its edge and then back at Luis whose face is still crimson with fury and hes still staring at me wideeyed spittle on his lips not saying anything\\n   What in thehelldoes that have to do withBlades I ask finally genuinely confused Wipe your mouth\\n   Thats why Ihate Japanese food he screams back Sashimi California roll OhJesus He makes a gagging motion with one finger going down his throat\\n   Carruthers I stop still looking at him studying his face closely slightly freaked out unable to remember what I wanted to say\\n   What Bateman Carruthers asks leaning in\\n   Listen I cant believe this shit I scream I cant believe you didnt make the reservations forlater Were going to have towait\\n   What he screams cupping his ear as if it makes a difference\\n   We are going to have towait I scream louder\\n   This is not a problem he shouts\\n   The lead singer reaches out to us from the stage his hand outstretched and I wave him away Its okay Itsokay No Luis Yourewrong Its notokay I look over at Paul Owen who seems equally bored his hands clamped over both ears but still managing to confer with Courtney about something\\n   We wont have to wait Luis screams I promise\\n   Promisenothing you geek I scream then Is Paul Owen still handling the Fisher account\\n   I dont want you to be mad at me Patrick Luis screams desperately Itll beall right\\n   Oh Jesus forget it I scream Now listen to me is Paul Owen still handling the Fisher account\\n   Carruthers looks over at him and then back at me Yeah I guess I heard Ashley has chlamydia\\n   Im going to talk to him I shout getting up taking the empty seat next to Owen\\n   But when I sit down something strange on the stage catches my eye Bono has now moved across the stage following me to my seat and hes staring into my eyes kneeling at the edge of the stage wearing black jeans maybe Gitano sandals a leather vest with no shirt beneath it His body is white covered with sweat and its not worked out enough theres no muscle tone and what definition there might be is covered beneath a paltry amount of chest hair He has a cowboy hat on and his hair is pulled back into a ponytail and hes moaning some dirge I catch the lyric A hero is an insect in this world  and hehas a faint barely noticeable but nonetheless intense smirk on his face and it grows spreading across it confidently and while his eyes blaze the backdrop of the stage turns red and suddenly I get this tremendous surge of feeling this rush of knowledge and my own heart beats faster because of this and its not impossible to believe that an invisible cord attached to Bono has now encircled me and now the audience disappears and the music slows down gets softer and its just Bono onstage the stadiums deserted the band fades away\\n   And then everyone the audience the band reappears and the music slowly swells up and Bono turns away and Im left tingling my face flushed an aching erection pulsing against my thigh my hands clenched in fists of tension But suddenly everything stops as if a switch has been turned off the backdrop flashes back to white Bono is on the other side of the stage now and everything the feeling in my heart the sensation combing my brain vanishes and now more than ever I need to know about the Fisher account that Owen is handling and this information seems vital more pertinent than the bond I feel I have with Bono who is now dissolving and remote I turn to Paul Owen\\n   Hey I shout Hows it going\\n   Those guys over there He motions toward a group of stagehands standing by the edge of the far side of the front row peering into the crowd conferring with one another They were pointing over here at Evelyn and Courtney and Ashley\\n   Who are they I shout Are they from Oppenheimer\\n   No Owen shouts back I think theyre roadies who look for chicks to go backstage and have sex with the band\\n   Oh I scream I thought maybe they worked at Barneys\\n   No he shouts Theyre calledtrimcoordinators\\n   How do you knowthat\\n   I have a cousin who manages All We Need of Hell he shouts\\n   Its irritating that you know this I say\\n   What he shouts\\n   Are you still handling the Fisher account I shout back\\n   Yeah he screams Lucked out huh Marcus\\n   You sure did I scream How did you get it\\n   Well I had the Ransom account and things just fell into place He shrugs helplessly the smooth bastard You know\\n   Wow I shout\\n   Yeah he shouts back then turns around in his seat and shouts at two dumblooking fat girls from New Jersey passing an oversize joint between them one of the cows wrapped in what Im guessing is the Irish flag Will you please put yourskunkweedaway itreeks\\n   I want it I shout staring at his perfect even part even his scalp is tan\\n   You wantwhat he shouts back Marijuana\\n   No Nothing I scream my throat raw and I slump back into my seat stare emptily at the stage biting my thumbnail ruining yesterdays manicure\\n   We leave after Evelyn and Ashley return and later in the limousine racing back toward Manhattan to make the reservation at Brussels another bottle of Cristal opened Reagan still on the television set Evelyn and Ashley tell us that two bouncers accosted them near the ladies room and demanded they come backstage I explain who they were and what purpose they serve\\n   Mygod Evelyn gasps Are you telling me Ive beentrimcoordinated\\n   I bet Bono has a small dick Owen says staring out the tinted window Irish you know\\n   Do you think they had an automated teller back there Luis asks\\n   Ashley Evelyn shouts Did you hear that Weve beentrimcoordinated\\n   How does my hair look I ask\\n   More Cristal Courtney asks Luis\\n   A Glimpse of a Thursday Afternoon\\n   and its midafternoon and I find myself standing at a phone booth on a corner somewhere downtown I dont know where but Im sweaty and a pounding migraine thumps dully in my head and Im experiencing a majorleague anxiety attack searching my pockets for Valium Xanax a leftover Halcion anything and all I find are three faded Nuprin in a Gucci pillbox so I pop all three into my mouth and swallow them down with a Diet Pepsi and I couldnt tell you where it came from if my life depended on it Ive forgotten who I had lunch with earlier and even more importantwhereWas it Robert Ailes at Beats Or was it Todd Hendricks at Ursulas the new Philip Duncan Holmes bistro in Tribeca Or was it Ricky Worrall and were we at Decembers Or would it have been Kevin Weber at Contra in NoHo Did I order the partridge sandwich on brioche with green tomatoes or a big plate of endive with clam sauce Oh godI cant remember I moan my clothes a linen and silk sport coat a cotton shirt pleated linen khald trousers all by Matsuda a silk tie with a Matsuda insignia with a belt from Coach Leatherware  drenched with sweat and I take off the jacket and wipe my face with it The phone keeps ringing but I dont know who Ive calledand I just stand on the corner RayBans balanced on my forehead at what feels like an odd crooked angle and then I hear a faint familiar sound coming through the wires  Jeans soft voice competing with the endless gridlock stuck on BroadwayThe Patty Winters Showthis morning was Aspirin Can It Save Your Life Jean I cry out HelloJean Patrick Is that you she calls back Hello JeanI needhelp I shout Patrick What Jesse Forrest called Jean says He has a reservation at Melrose tonight at eight and Ted Madison and Jamie Conway want to meet you for drinks at Harrys Patrick Jean asks Where are you Jean I sigh wiping my nose Im not Oh and Todd Lauder called Jean says no I mean Chris  oh no it was Todd Lauder Yeah Todd Lauder Oh god I moan loosening my tie the August sun beating down on me what do you say you dumb bitch NotBicePatrick The reservation is atMelroseNot Bice What am Idoing I cry out Where are you and then Patrick Whats wrong Im not going to make it Jean I say then choke out to the office this afternoon Why She sounds depressed or maybe its just simple confusion Just say no I scream What is it Patrick Are you all right she asks Stop sounding so fucking sadJesus I shout Patrick Im sorry I mean I meant to say just say no but I hang up on her and lunge away from the phone booth and the Walkman around my neck suddenly feels like a boulder strapped around my throat and the sounds blaring from it  early Dizzy Gillespie  deeply irritate and I have to throw the Walkman a cheap one into the nearest trash can I stumble into and then I hang on to the rim of the can breathing heavily the cheap Matsuda jacket tied around my waist staring at the stillfunctioning Walkman the sun melting the mousse on my head and it mingles with the sweat pouring down my face and I can taste it when I lick my lips and it starts tasting good and Im suddenly ravenous and I run my hand through my hair and lick greedily at the palm while moving up Broadway ignoring the old ladies passing out fliers past jeans stores music blasting from inside pouring out onto the streets peoples movements matching the beat of the song a Madonna single Madonna crying out life is a mystery everyone must stand alone bike messengers whiz by and Im standing on a corner scowling at them but people pass oblivious no one pays attention they dont even pretend tonotpay attention and this fact sobers me up long enough that I walk toward a nearby Conrans to buy a teapot but just when I assume my normalcy has returned and Im all straightened out my stomach tightens and the cramps are so intense that I hobble into the nearest doorway and clutch my waist doubling over with pain and as suddenly as it appears it fades long enough for me to stand up straight and rush into the next hardware store I come across and once inside I buy a set of butcher knives an ax a bottle of hydrochloric acid and then at the pet store down the block a Habitrail and two white rats that I plan to torture with the knives and acid but somewhere later in the afternoon I leave the package with the rats in it at the Pottery Barn while shopping for candles or did I finally buy the teapot Now Im lunging up Lafayette sweating and moaning and pushing people out of my way foam pouring out of my mouth stomach contracting with horrendous abdominal cramps they might be caused by the steroids but thats doubtful  and I calm myself down enough to walk into a Gristedes rush up and down the aisles and shoplift a canned ham that I calmly walk out of the store with hidden under the Matsuda jacket and down the block where I try to hide in the lobby of the American Felt Building breaking the tin open with my keys ignoring the doorman who at first seems to recognize me then after I start stuffing handfuls of the ham into my mouth scooping the lukewarm pink meat out of the can getting it stuck beneath my nails threatens to call the police Im outta there outside throwing up all the ham leaning against a poster forLes Misrablesat a bus stop and I kiss the drawing of Eponines lovely face her lips leaving brown streaks of bile smeared across her soft unassuming face and the word DYKE scrawled beneath it Loosening my suspenders ignoring beggars beggars ignoring me sweatdrenched delirious I find myself back downtown in Tower Records and I compose myself muttering over and over to no one Ive gotta return my videotapes Ive gotta return my videotapes and I buy two copies of my favorite compact disc Bruce WillisThe Return of Brunoand then Im stuck in the revolving door for five full spins and I trip out onto the street bumping into Charles Murphy from Kidder Peabody or it could be Bruce Barker from Morgan Stanleywhoeverand he says Hey Kinsley and I belch into his face my eyes rolling back into my head greenish bile dripping in strings from my bared fangs and he suggests unfazed See you at Fluties okay Severt too I screech and while backing away I bump into a fruit stand at a Korean deli collapsing stacks of apples and oranges and lemons that go rolling onto the sidewalk over the curb and into the street where theyre splattered by cabs and cars and buses and trucks and Im apologizing delirious offering a screaming Korean my platinum AmEx accidentally then a twenty which he immediately takes but still he grabs me by the lapels of the stained wrinkled jacket Ive forced myself back into and when I look up into his slantyeyed round face he suddenly bursts into the chorus of Lou Christies Lightnin Strikes I pull away horrified stumbling uptown toward home but people places stores keep interrupting me a drug dealer on Thirteenth Street who offers me crack and blindly I wave a fifty at him and he says Oh man gratefully and shakes my hand pressing five vials into my palm which I proceed toeat wholeand the crack dealer stares at me trying to mask his deep disturbance with an amused glare and I grab him by the neck and croak out my breath reeking The best engine is in the BMW iL and then I move on to a phone booth where I babble gibberish at the operator until I finally spit out my credit card number and then Im speaking to the front office of Xclusive where I cancel a massage appointment that I never made Im able to compose myself by simply staring at my feet actually at the A Testoni loafers kicking pigeons aside and without even noticing I enter a shabby delicatessen on Second Avenue and Im still confused mixed up sweaty and I walk over to a short fat Jewish woman old and hideously dressed Listen I say I have a reservation Bateman Wheres the matre d I know Jackie Mason and she sighs I can seat you Dont need a reservation as she reaches for a menu She leads me to a horrible table in back near the rest rooms and I grab the menu away from her and rush to a booth up front and Im appalled by the cheapness of the food  Is thisa goddamn joke  and sensing a waitress is near I order without looking up A cheeseburger Id like a cheeseburger and Id like it medium rare Im sorry sir the waitress says No cheese Kosher and I have no idea what the fuck shes talking about and I say Fine Akosherburger butwith cheeseMonterey Jack perhaps and oh god I moan sensing more cramps coming on No cheese sir she says Kosher Oh god is this anightmareyou fuckingJew I mutter and then Cottage cheeseJustbring it Ill get the manager she says Whatever But bring me a beverage in the meanwhile I hiss Yes she asks A vanilla milk shake No milk shakesKosher she says then Ill get the manager Nowait Mister Ill get the manager What in the fuck is going on I ask seething my platinum AmEx already slapped on the greasy table No milk shakeKosher she says thickupped just one of billions of people who have passed over this planet Then bring me a fucking vanillamalted I roar spraying spit all over my open menu She just stares Extra thick I add She walks away to get the manager and when I see him approaching a bald carbon copy of the waitress I get up and scream Fuck yourself you retarded cocksucking kike and I run out of the delicatessen and onto the street where this\\n   Yale Club\\n   What are the rules for a sweater vest Van Patten asks the table\\n   What do you mean McDermott furrows his brow takes a sip of Absolut\\n   Yes I say Clarify\\n   Well is it strictly informal\\n   Or can it be worn with asuit I interrupt finishing his sentence\\n   Exactly He smiles\\n   Well according to Bruce Boyer I begin\\n   Wait Van Patten stops me Is he with Morgan Stanley\\n   No I smile Hes not with Morgan Stanley\\n   Wasnt he a serial killer McDermott asks suspiciously then moans Dont tell me he was another serial killer BatemanNot another serial killer\\n   No McDufushe wasnt aserialkiller I say turning back to Van Patten but before continuing turn back to McDermott That really pisses me off\\n   But youalwaysbring them up McDermott complains And always in this casual educational sort of way I mean I dont want to know anything about Son of Sam or the fucking Hillside Strangler or Ted Bundy or Featherhead for god sake\\n   Featherhead Van Patten asks Whos Featherhead He sounds exceptionally dangerous\\n   He means Leatherface I say teeth tightly clenched\\n   Leatherface He was part of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\n   Oh Van Patten smiles politely Of course\\n   And hewasexceptionally dangerous I say\\n   And now okay go on Bruce Boyer what didhedo McDermott demands releasing a sigh rolling his eyes up Lets see skin them alive Starve them to death Run them over Feed them to dogs What\\n   You guys I say shaking my head then teasingly admit He did somethingfar worse\\n   Like what take them to dinner at McManuss new restaurant McDermott asks\\n   That would do it Van Patter agrees Did you go It was grubby wasnt it\\n   Did you have the meat loaf McDermott asks\\n   The meat loaf Van Pattens in shock What about theinterior What about the fuckingtablecloths\\n   But did youhavethe meat loaf McDermott presses\\n   Of course I had the meat loafandthe squabandthe marlin Van Patten says\\n   Oh god I forgot about the marlin McDermott groans The marlin chili\\n   After reading Millers review in theTimes who in their right mindwouldntorder the meat loaf or the marlin for that matter\\n   But Miller got it wrong McDermott says It was just grubby The quesadilla with papaya Usually a good dish butthereJesus He whistles shaking his head\\n   Andcheap Van Patten adds\\n   So cheap McDermott is in total agreement And the watermelonbrittle tart\\n   Gentlemen I cough Ahem I hate to interrupt but\\n   Okay okay go on McDermott says Tell us more about Charles Moyer\\n   Bruce Boyer I correct him He was the author ofElegance A Guide to Quality in Menswear Then as an aside And no Craig he wasnt a serial killer in his spare time\\n   What did Brucie baby have to say McDermott asks chewing on ice\\n   Youre a clod Its an excellent book His theory remains we shouldnt feel restricted from wearing a sweater vest with a suit I say Did you hear me call you a clod\\n   Yeah\\n   But doesnt he point out that a vest shouldnt overpower the suit Van Patten offers tentatively\\n   Yes Im mildly irritated that Van Patten has done his homework but asks for advice nonetheless I calmly continue With discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or charcoal gray vest A plaid suit would call for a bolder vest\\n   And remember McDermott adds with a regular vest the last button should be left undone\\n   I glance sharply at McDermott He smiles sips his drink and then smacks his lips satisfied\\n   Why Van Patten wants to know\\n   Its traditional I say still glaring at McDermott But its also more comfortable\\n   Will wearing suspenders help the vest sit better I heapr Van Patten ask\\n   Why I ask turning to face him\\n   Well since you avoid the He stops stuck looking for the right word\\n   Encumbrance of I begin\\n   The belt buckle McDermott finishes\\n   Sure Van Patten says\\n   You have to remember Again Im interrupted by McDermott\\n   Remember that while the vest should be in keeping with the color and the style of the suit completely avoid matching the vests pattern with your socks or tie McDermott says smiling at me at Van Patten\\n   I thought you hadnt read this this book I stammer angrily You just told me you couldnt tell the difference between Bruce Boyer and and John Wayne Gacy\\n   It came back to me He shrugs\\n   Listen I turn back to Van Patten finding McDermotts oneupmanship totally cheap Wearing argyle socks with as argyle vest will look too studied\\n   You think so he asks\\n   Youll look like you consciously worked for this look I say then suddenly upset turn back to McDermott FeatherheadHow in the hell did you get Featherhead from Leatherface\\n   Ah cheer up Bateman he says slapping me on the back then massaging my neck Whats the matter No shiatsu this morning\\n   Keep touching me like this I say eyes shut tight entire body wired and ticking coiled up readywanting to spring and youll draw back a stump\\n   Whoa hold on there little buddy McDermott says backing off in mock fear The two of them giggle like idiots and give each other highfive completely unaware that Id cut his hands off and much more with pleasure\\n   The three of us David Van Patten Craig McDermott and myself are sitting in the dining room of the Yale Club at lunch Van Patten is wearing a glenplaid woolcrepe suit from Krizia Uomo a Brooks Brothers shirt a tie from Adirondack and shoes by ColeHaan McDermott is wearing a lambs wool and cashmere blazer worsted wool flannel trousers by Ralph Lauren a shirt and tiealsoby Ralph Lauren and shoes from Brooks Brothers Im wearing a tickweave wool suit with a windowpane overplaid a cotton shirt by Luciano Barbera a tie by Luciano Barbera shoes from ColeHaan and nonprescription glasses by Bausch LombThe Patty Winters Showthis morning was about Nazis and inexplicably I got a real charge out of watching it Though I wasnt exactly charmed by their deeds I didnt find them unsympathetic either nor I might add did most of the members of the audience One of the Nazis in a rare display of humor even juggled grapefruits and delighted I sat up in bed and clapped\\n   Luis Carruthers sits five tables away from this one dressed as if hed had some kind of frog attack this morning hes wearing an unidentifiable suit from some French tailor and if Im not mistaken the bowler hat on the floor beneath his chair also belongs to him  it has Luis written all over it He smiles but I pretend not to have noticed I worked out at Xclusive for two hours this morning and since the three of us have taken the rest of the afternoon off were all getting massages We havent ordered yet in fact we havent even seen menus Weve just been drinking A bottle of champagne is what Craig originally wanted but David shook his head vehemently and said Out outout when this was suggested and so we ordered drinks instead I keep watching Luis and whenever he looks over at our table I tip my head back and laugh even if what Van Patten or McDermotts saying isnt particularly funny which is practically always Ive perfected my fake response to a degree where its so naturalsounding that no one notices Luis stands up wipes his mouth with a napkin and glances over here again before exiting the dining area and Im supposing goes to the mens room\\n   But theres a limit Van Patten is saying The point is I mean I dont want to spend the evening with the Cookie Monster\\n   But youre still dating Meredith so uh whats the difference I ask Naturally he doesnt hear\\n   But ditsy is cute McDermott says Ditsy is very cute\\n   Bateman Van Patten asks Any style opinions on ditsiness\\n   What I ask getting up\\n   Ditsy No McDermott this time Ditsys desirablecomprende\\n   Listen I say pushing my chair in I just want everyone to know that Im profamily and antidrug Excuse me\\n   As I walk away Van Patten grabs a passing waiter and says his voice fading Is this tap water I dont drink tap water Bring me an Evian or something okay\\n   Would Courtney like me less if Luis was dead This is the question I have to face with no clear answer burning back across my mind as I make my way slowly through the dining room waving to someone who looks like Vincent Morrison someone else who Im fairly sure is someone who looks like Tom Newman Would Courtney spend more time with me the time she now spends with Luis  if he was out of the picture no longer an alternative if he was perhapsdead If Luis were killed would Courtney be upset Could I genuinely be of comfort without laughing in her face my own spite doubling back on me giving everything away Is the fact that she dates me behind his back what excites her my body or the size of my dick Why for that matter do I want to please Courtney If she likes me only for my muscles the heft of my cock then shes a shallow bitchButa physically superior nearperfectlooking shallow bitch andthatcan override anything except maybe bad breath or yellow teeth either of which is a real dealbreaker Would I ruin things by strangling Luis If I married Evelyn would she make me buy her Lacroix gowns until we finalized our divorce Have the South African colonial forces and the Sovietbacked black guerrillas found peace yet in Namibia Or would the world be a safer kinder place if Luis was hacked to bitsMyworld might so why not There really is noother handIts really even too late to be asking these questions since now Im in the mens room staring at myself in the mirror tan and haircut perfect  checking out my teeth which are completely straight and white and gleaming Winking at my reflection I breathe in sliding on a pair of leather Armam gloves and then make my way toward the stall Luis occupies The mens room is deserted All the stalls are empty except for the one at the end the door not locked left slightly ajar the sound of Luis whistling something fromLes Misrablesgetting almost oppressively louder as I approach\\n   Hes standing in the stall his back to me wearing a cashmere blazer pleated wool trousers a cottonsilk white shirt pissing into the toilet I can tell he senses movement in the stall because he stiffens noticeably and the sound of his urine hitting water stops abruptly in midstream In slow motion my own heavy breathing blocking out all other sounds my vision blurring slightly around the edges my hands move up over the collar of his cashmere blazer and cottonflannel shirt circling his neck until my thumbs meet at the nape and my index fingers touch each other just above Luiss Adams apple I start to squeeze tightening my grip but its loose enough to let Luis turn around still in slow motion  so he can stand facing me one hand over his wool and silk Polo sweater the other hand reaching up His eyelids flutter for an instant then widen which is exactly what I want I want to see Luiss face contort and turn purple and I want him to know who it is who is killing him I want to be the last face the lastthingthat Luis sees before he dies and I want to cry out Im fucking Courtney Do you hear meIm fucking Courtney Hahaha and have these be the last words the lastsoundshe hears until his own gurglings accompanied by the crunching of his trachea drown everything else out Luis stares at me and I tense the muscles in my arms preparing myself for a struggle that disappointingly never comes\\n   Instead he looks down at my wrists and for a moment wavers as if hes undecided about something and then he lowers his head andkisses my left wrist and when he looks back up at me shyly its with an expression thats loving and only part awkward His right hand reaches up and tenderly touches the side of my face I stand there frozen my arms still stretched out in front of me fingers still circled around Luiss throat\\n   God Patrick he whispers Whyhere\\n   His hand is playing with my hair now I look over at the side of the stall where someone has scratched into the paintEdwin gives marvelous headand Im still paralyzed in this position and gazing at the words confused studying the frame surrounding the words as if that contained an answer a truth Edwin Edwin who I shake my head to clear it and look back at Luis who has this horrible lovestruck grin plastered on his face and I try to squeeze harder my face twisted with exertion but Icant do it my handswont tighten and my arms still stretched out look ludicrous and useless in their fixed position\\n   Ive seen you looking at me he says panting Ive noticed your he gulps  hot body\\n   He tries to kiss me on the lips but I back away into the stall door accidentally closing it I drop my hands from Luiss neck and he takes them and immediately places them back I drop them once again and stand there contemplating my next move but Im immobile\\n   Dont be shy he says\\n   I take a deep breath close my eyes count to ten open them and make a helpless attempt to lift my arms back up to strangle Luis but they feel weighed down and lifting them becomes an impossible task\\n   You dont know how long Ive wanted it Hes sighing rubbing my shoulders trembling Ever since that Christmas party at Arizona  You know the one you were wearing that red striped paisley Armani tie\\n   For the first time I notice his pants are still unzipped and calmly and without difficulty I turn out of the stall and move over to a sink to wash my hands but my gloves are still on and I dont want to take them off The bathroom at the Yale Club suddenly seems to me to be the coldest room in the universe and I shudder involuntarily Luis trails behind touching my jacket leaning next to me at the sink\\n   I want you he says in a low faggoty whisper and when I slowly turn my head to glare at him while hunched over the sink seething my eye contact radiating revulsion he adds too\\n   I storm out of the mens room bumping into Brewster Whipple I think I smile at the matre d and after shakinghishand I make a run for the closing elevator but Im too late and I cry out pounding a fist against the doors cursing Composing myself I notice the matre d conferring with a waiter the two of them looking my way questioningly and so I straighten up smile shyly and wave at them Luis strides over calmly still grinningflushed and I just stand there and let him walk up to me He says nothing\\n   What is it I finally hiss\\n   Where are you going he whispers bewildered\\n   I Ive gotta Stumped I look around the crowded dining room then back at Luiss quivering yearning face Ive gotta return some videotapes I say jabbing at the elevator button then my patience shot I start to walk away and head back toward my table\\n   Patrick he calls out\\n   I whirl around What\\n   He mouths Ill call you with this expression on his face that lets me know thatassuresme my secret is safe with him Oh my god I practically gag and shaking visibly I sit back at our table completely defeated my gloves still on and gulp down the rest of a watery JB on the rocks As soon as Ive seated myself Van Patten asks Hey Bateman whats the right way to wear a tie bar or clasp\\n   While a tie holder is by no means required businesswear it adds to a clean neat overall appearance But the accessory shouldnt dominate the tie Choose a simple gold bar or a small clip and place it at the lower end of the tie at a downward fortyfivedegree angle\\n   Killing Dog\\n   Courtney calls too wasted on Elavil to meet me for a coherent dinner at Cranes the new Kitty Oates Sanders restaurant in Gramercy Park where Jean my secretary made reservations for us last week and Im nonplussed Even though it got excellent reviews one inNew Yorkmagazine the other inThe Nation I dont complain or persuade Courtney to change her mind since I have two files I should go over andThe Patty Winters ShowI taped this morning hasnt been watched yet Its sixty minutes about women whove had mastectomies which at seventhirty over breakfast before the office I couldnt bear to sit through but after today hanging out at the office where the airconditioning broke down a tedious lunch with Cunningham at Odeon my fucking Chinese cleaners unable to get bloodstains out of another Soprani jacket four videotapes overdue that ended up costing me a fortune a twentyminute wait at the Stairmasters  Ive adapted these events have toughened me and Im prepared to deal with this particular topic\\n   Two thousand abdominal crunches and thirty minutes of rope jumping in the living room the Wurlitzer jukebox blasting The Lion Sleeps Tonight over and over even though I worked out in the gym today for close to two hours After this I get dressed to pick up groceries at DAgostinos blue jeans by Armani a white Polo shirt an Armani sport coat no tie hair slicked back with Thompson mousse since its drizzling a pair of black waterproof laceups by Manolo Blahnik three knives and two guns carried in a black Epi leather attach case  by Louis Vuitton because its cold and I dont want to fuck up my manicure a pair of Armani deerskin gloves Finally a belted trench coat in black leather by Cianfranco Ferr that cost four thousand dollars Though its only a short walk to DAgostinos I put on a CD Walkman anyway with the long version of Bon Jovis Wanted Dead or Alive already in it I grab an Etro woodhandled paisley umbrella from Bergdorf Goodman three hundred dollars on sale off a newly installed umbrella rack in the closet near the entranceway and Im out the door\\n   After the office I worked out at Xclusive and once home made obscene phone calls to young Dalton girls the numbers I chose coming from the register I stole a copy of from the administration office when I broke in last Thursday night Im a corporate raider I whispered lasciviously into the cordless phone I orchestrate hostile takeovers What do you think of that and I would pause before making sucking noises freakish piglike grunts and then ask Huhbitch Most of the time I could tell they were frightened and this pleased me greatly enabled me to maintain a strong pulsing erection for the duration of the phone calls until one of the girls Hilary Wallace asked unfazed Dad is that you and whatever enthusiasm Id built up plummeted Vaguely disappointed I made a few more calls but only halfheartedly opening todays mail while doing so and I finally hung up in midsentence when I came across a personalized reminder from Clifford the guy who helps me at Armani that there was a private sale at the boutique on Madisontwo weeks agoand though I figured out that one of the doormen probably withheld the card to piss me off it still doesnt erase the fact that Imissed the fucking saleand dwelling over this loss while wandering down Central Park West somewhere around Seventysixth Seventyfifth it strikes me profoundly that the world is more often than not a bad and cruel place\\n   Someone who looks almost exactly like Jason Taylor black hair slicked back navy doublebreasted cashmere coat with a beaver collar black leather boots Morgan Stanley  passes beneath a streetlamp and nods as I turn down the volume on the Walkman to hear him say Hello Kevin and I catch a whiff of Grey Flannel and still walking I look back at the person who resembles Taylor whocould be Taylor wondering if hes still dating Shelby Phillips when I almost stumble over a beggar lying on the street sprawled in the doorway of an abandoned restaurant a place Tony McManus opened two summers ago called Amnesia  and shes black and outofhermind crazy repeating the words Money please help mister money please help mister like some kind of Buddhist chant I try to lecture her on the merits of getting a job somewhere  perhaps at Cineplex Odeon I suggested not impolitely  silently debating whether or not to open the briefcase pull out the knife or the gun But it strikes me that shes too easy a target to be truly satisfying so I tell her to go to hell and turn up the Walkman just as Bon Jovi cries Its all the same only the names have changed and move on stopping at an automated teller to take three hundred dollars out for no particular reason all the bills crisp freshly printed twenties and I delicately place them in my gazelleskin wallet so as not to wrinkle them At Columbus Circle a juggler wearing a trench cloak and top hat who is usually at this location afternoons and who calls himself Stretch Man performs in front of a small uninterested crowd though I smell prey and he seems fully worthy of my wrath I move on in search of a less dorky target Though if hed been a mime odds are hed already be dead\\n   Faded posters of Donald Trump on the cover ofTimemagazine cover the windows of another abandoned restaurant what used to be Palaze and this fills me with a newfound confidence Ive arrived at DAgostinos standing directly in front of it gazing into it and I have an almost overwhelming urge to walk in and browse through each aisle filling my basket with bottles of balsamic vinegar and sea salt roam through the vegetable and produce stands inspecting the color tones of red peppers and yellow peppers and green peppers and purple peppers deciding what flavor whatshapeof gingerbread cookie to buy but Im still longing for something deeper something undefined to do beforehand and I start to stalk the dark cold streets off Central Park West and I catch sight of my face reflected in the tinted windows of a limousine thats parked in front of Caf des Artistes and my mouth is moving involuntarily my tongue wetter than usual and my eyes are blinking uncontrollably of their own accord In the streetlamps glare my shadow is vividly cast on the wet pavement and I can see my gloved hands moving alternately clutching themselves into fistsfingers stretching wriggling and I have to stop in the middle of Sixtyseventh Street to calm myself down whisper soothing thoughts anticipating DAgostinos a reservation at Dorsia the new Mike and the Mechanics CD and it takes an awesome amount of strength to fight down the urge to start slapping myself in the face\\n   Coming slowly up the street is an old queer wearing a cashmere turtleneck a paisley wool ascot and a felt hat walking a brown and white sharpei its bunchedup face sniffing low to the ground The two of them get closer passing beneath one streetlamp then another and Ive composed myself sufficiently to slowly take off the Walkman and inconspicuously unlock the briefcase Im standing in the middle of the thin strip of sidewalk next to a white BMW i and the queer with the sharpei is now within feet of me and I get a good look at him late fifties pudgy with obscenely healthylooking pink skin no wrinkles all of this topped off with a ridiculous mustache that accentuates his feminine features He gives me the onceover with a quizzical smile while the sharpei sniffs a tree then a garbage bag sitting next to the BMW\\n   Nice dog I smile leaning down\\n   The sharper eyes me warily then growls\\n   Richard The man glares at the dog then looks back up at me apologetic and I can sense hes flattered not only that Ive noticed his dog but that Ive actually stopped to talk to him about it and I swear the old bastard is positively flushed creaming in his tacky loose corduroys from Im guessing Ralph Lauren\\n   Its okay I tell him and pet the dog gently laying the briefcase on the ground Its a sharpei right\\n   No Sharpei he says lisping a way Ive never heard it pronounced before\\n   Sharpei I try to say it the same way he does still stroking the velvet bumpiness of the dogs neck and back\\n   No He laughs flirtatiously Sharpei Accent on the last syllable Akthent on thee latht thyllable\\n   Well whatever I say standing up and grinning boyishly Its a beautiful animal\\n   Oh thank you he says then exathperated It costs a fortune\\n   Really Why I ask leaning down again and stroking the dog Hiya Richard Hiya little fella\\n   You wouldntbelieveit he says You see the bags around its eyes have to be lifted surgicallyevery two yearsso we have to go all the way down to Key West which has the only vet I really trust in this world  and a little snip a little tuck and Richard can see splendidly once again cant you baby He nods approvingly as I continue to run my hand seductively across the dogs back\\n   Well I say He looks great\\n   Theres a pause in which I watch the dog The owner keeps eyeing me and then he just cant help it he has to break the silence\\n   Listen he says I really hate to ask this\\n   Go ahead I urge\\n   Oh gosh this is so silly he admits chuckling\\n   I start laughing Why\\n   Are you a model he asks not laughing anymore I could swear Ive seen you in a magazine or somewhere\\n   No Im not I say deciding not to lie But Im flattered\\n   Well you look just like a movie star He waves a limp wrist then I dont know and finally he lisps the following I swear to God  to himself Oh stop it silly youre embarrassing yourself\\n   I lean down giving the appearance of picking up the briefcase but because of the shadows Im leaning into he doesnt see me pull out the knife the sharpest one with the serrated edge and Im asking him what he paid for Richard naturally but also very deliberately without even looking up to check to see if other people are walking down the street In one swift movement I pick the dog up quickly by the neck and hold it with my left arm pushing it back against the streetlamp while it nips at me trying to bite my gloves its jaws snapping but since Ive got such a tight grip on its throat it cant bark and I can actuallyhearmy hand crush its trachea I push the serrated blade into its stomach and quickly slice open its hairless belly in a squirt of brown blood its legs kicking and clawing at me then blue and red intestines bulge out and I drop the dog onto the sidewalk the queer just standing there still gripping the leash and this has all happened so fast hes in shock and he just stares in horror saying oh my god oh my god as the sharpei drags itself around in a circle its tail wagging squealing and it starts licking and sniffing the pile of its own intestines spilled out in a mound on the sidewalk some still connected to its stomach and as it goes into its death throes still attached to its leash I whirl around on its owner and I push him back hard with a bloodied glove and start randomly stabbing him in the face and head finally slashing his throat open in two brief chopping motions an arc of redbrown blood splatters the white BMW i parked at the curb setting off its car alarm four fountainlike bursts coming from below his chin The spraylike sound of the blood He falls to the sidewalk shaking like mad blood still pumping as I wipe the knife clean on the front of his jacket and toss it back in the briefcase and begin to walk away but to make sure the old queer is really dead and not faking it they sometimes do I shoot him with a silencer twice in the face and then I leave almost slipping in the puddle of blood that has formed by the side of his head and Im down the street and out of darkness and like in a movie I appear in front of the DAgostinos sales clerks beckoning for me to enter and Im using an expired coupon for a box of oatbran cereal and the girl at the checkout counter black dumb slow  doesnt get it doesnt notice the expiration date has passed even though its the only thing I buy and I get a small but incendiary thrill when I walk out of the store opening the box stuffing handfuls of the cereal into my mouth trying to whistle Hip to Be Square at the same time and then Ive opened my umbrella and Im running down Broadway then up Broadway then down again screaming like a banshee my coat open flying out behind me like some kind of cape\\n   Girls\\n   Tonight an infuriating dinner at Raw Space with a vaguely ditzedout Courtney who keeps asking me questions about spa menus and George Bush and Tofutti that belong only in someones nightmare I utterly ignore her to no avail and while shes in midsentence Page Six Jackie O  I resort to waving our waiter over and ordering the cold corn chowder lemon bisque with peanuts and dill an arugula Caesar salad and swordfish meat loaf with kiwi mustard even though I already ordered this and he tells me so I look up at him not even trying to feign surprise and smile grimly Yes I did didnt I The Floridian cuisine looks impressive but the portions are small and costly especially in a place with a dish of crayons on each table Courtney draws a Laura Ashley print on her paper place mat and I draw the insides of Monica Lustgardens stomach and chest on mine and when Courtney charmed by what Im drawing inquires as to what it is I tell her Uh a watermelon The bill which I pay for with my platinum American Express card comes to over three hundred dollars Courtney looks okay in a Donna Karan wool jacket silk blouse andcashmere wool skirt Im wearing a tuxedo for no apparent reasonThe Patty Winters Showthis morning was about a new sport called Dwarf Tossing\\n   In the limousine dropping her off at Nells where were supposed to have drinks with Meredith Taylor Louise Samuelson and Pierce Towers I tell Courtney that I need to score some drugs and I promise that Ill be back before midnight Oh and tell Nell I say hi I add casually\\n   Just buy some downstairsif you have to forgodssake she whines\\n   But I promised someone Id stop bytheirplace Paranoia Understand I whine back\\n   Whos paranoid she asks eyes squinting I dont get it\\n   Honey the drugs downstairs are usually a notch below NutraSweet in terms of potency I tell her Youknow\\n   Dont implicateme Patrick she warns\\n   Just go inside and order me a Fostersokay\\n   Where are you really going she asks after a beat now suspicious\\n   Im going to Nojs I say Im buying coke from Noj\\n   But Noj is the chef at Deck Chairs she says as Im pushing her out of the limousine Noj isnt a drug dealer Hes achef\\n   Dont have a hissy fit Courtney I sigh my hands on her back\\n   But dont lie to me about Noj she whines struggling to stay in the car Noj is the chef at Deck Chairs Did you hear me\\n   I stare at her dumbfounded caught in the harsh lights hung above the ropes outside Nells\\n   I mean Fiddler I finally admit meekly Im going to Fiddlers to score\\n   Youre impossible she mutters walking away from the limo There is something seriously wrong with you\\n   Ill be back I call out after her slamming the limos door shut then I cackle gleefully to myself while relighting a cigar Dont youbeton it\\n   I tell the chauffeur to head over to the meatpacking district just west of Nells near the bistro Florent to look for prostitutes and after heavily scanning the area twice actually Ive spentmonths prowling this section of town for the appropriate babe I find her on the corner of Washington and Thirteenth Shes blond and slim and young trashy but not an escort bimbo and most important sheswhite which is a rarity in these parts Shes wearing tight cutoff shorts a white Tshirt and a cheap leather jacket and except for a bruise over her left knee her skin is pale all over including the face though her thickly lipsticked mouth is done up in pink Behind her in fourfoottall red block letters painted on the side of an abandoned brick warehouse is the word M E A T and the way the letters are spaced awakens something in me and above the building like a backdrop is a moonless sky which earlier in the afternoon was hung with clouds but tonight isnt\\n   The limousine cruises up alongside the girl Through its tinted windows closer up shes paler the blond hair now seems bleached and her facial features indicate someone even younger than I first imagined and because shes the only white girl Ive seen tonight in this section of town she seems whether she is or not  especially clean you could easily mistake her for one of the NYU girls walking home from Mars a girl who has been drinking Seabreezes all night while moving across a dance floor to the new Madonna songs a girl who perhaps afterwards had a fight with her boyfriend someone named Angus or Nick or Pokey a girl on her way to Florent to gossip with friends to order another Seabreeze perhaps or maybe a cappuccino or a glass of Evian water  and unlike most of the whores around here she barely registers the limousine as it pulls up next to her and stops idling Instead she lingers casually pretending to be unaware of what the limousine actually signifies\\n   When the window opens she smiles but looks away The following exchange takes place in less than a minute\\n   I havent seen you around here I say\\n   You just havent been looking she says really cool\\n   Would you like to see my apartment I ask flipping the light on inside the back of the limo so she can see my face the tuxedo Im wearing She looks at the limousine then at me then back at the limo I reach into my gazelleskin wallet\\n   Im not supposed to she says looking off into a pocket of darkness between two buildings across the street but when her eyes fall back on me she notices the hundreddollar bill Im holding out to her and without asking what Im doing without asking what it is I really want of her without even asking if Im a cop she takes the bill and then Imallowed to rephrase my question Do you want to come up to my apartment or not I ask this grinning\\n   Im not supposed to she says again but after another glance at the black long car and at the bill shes now putting into her hip pocket and at the bum shuffling toward the limousine a cup jangling with coins held in a scabby outstretched arm she manages to answer But I can make an exception\\n   Do you take American Express I ask switching the light off\\n   Shes still gazing out into that wall of darkness as if looking for a sign from someone invisible She shifts her stare to meet mine and when I repeat Do you take American Express she looks at me like Im crazy but I smile pointlessly anyway while holding the door open and tell her Im joking Come on get in She nods to someone across the street and I guide this girl into the back of the darkened limousine slamming the door then locking it\\n   Back in my apartment while Christie takes a bath I dont know her real name I havent asked but I told her to respondonlywhen I call her Christie I dial the number for Cabana Bi Escort Service and using my gold American Express card order a woman a blond who services couples I give the address twice and afterwards again stressblondThe guy on the other end of the line some old dago assures me that someone blond will be at my door within the hour\\n   After flossing and changing into a pair of silk Polo boxer shorts and a cotton Bill Blass sleeveless Tshirt I walk into the bathroom where Christie lies on her back in the tub sipping white wine from a thinstemmed Steuben wineglass I sit on the tubs marble edge and pour Monique Van Frere herbscented bath oil into it while inspecting the body lying in the milky water For a long time my mind races becomes flooded with impurities her head is within my reach is mine to crush at this very moment my urge to strike out to insult and punish her rises then subsides and afterwards Im able to point out Thats a very fine chardonnay youre drinking\\n   After a long pause my hand squeezing a small childlike breast I say I want you to clean your vagina\\n   She stares up at me with this seventeenyearolds gaze then looks down at the length of her body soaking in the tub With the mildest of shrugs she places the glass on the tubs edge and moves a hand down to the sparse hair also blond below her flat porcelainsmooth stomach and then she spreads her legs slightly\\n   No I say quietly From behind Get on your knees\\n   She shrugs again\\n   I want to watch I explain You have a very nice body I say urging her on\\n   She rolls over kneeling on all fours her ass raised up above the water and I move to the other edge of the tub to get a better view of her cunt which she fingers with a soapy hand I move my hand above her moving wrist to her asshole which I spread and with a dab of the bath oil finger lightly It contracts she sighs I remove the finger then slide it into her cunt which hangs below it both our fingers moving in then out then back into her Shes wet inside and using this wetness I move my index finger back up to her asshole and slide it in easily up to the knuckle She gasps twice and pushes herself back onto it while still fingering her cunt This goes on for a while until the doorman rings announcing that Sabrina has arrived I tell Christie to get out of the tub and dry off to choose a robe but not the Bijan  from the closet and meet me and our guest in the living room for drinks I move back to the kitchen where I pour a glass of wine for Sabrina\\n   Sabrina however isnota blond And standing in the doorway after my initial shock subsides I finally let her in Her hairis brownishblond notrealblond and though this infuriates me I dont say anything because shes also very pretty not as young as Christie but not too used up either In short she looks like shell be worth whatever it is Im paying her by the hour I calm down enough to become totally unangry when she takes off her coat and reveals a hardbody dressed in tight black peg pants and a flowerprint halter top with black pointytoed highheeled shoes Relieved I lead her into the living room and position her on the white downfilled sofa and without asking if she wants anything to drink bring her a glass of white wine and a coaster to place it on from the Mauna Kea Hotel in Hawaii The Broadway cast recording ofLes Misrablesis playing on CD from the stereo When Christie comes in from the bathroom to join us wearing a Ralph Lauren terrycloth robe her blond hair slicked back looking white now because of the bath I place her on the couch next to Sabrina they nod hello  and then I take a seat in the Nordian chrome and teakwood chair across from the couch I decide its probably best if we get to know each other before we adjourn to the bedroom and so I break a long not unpleasant silence by clearing my throat and asking a few questions\\n   So I start crossing my legs Dont you want to know what I do\\n   The two of them stare at me for a long time Fixed smiles locked on their faces they glance at each other before Christie unsure shrugs and quietly answers No\\n   Sabrina smiles takes this as a cue and agrees No not really\\n   I stare at the two of them for a minute before recrossing my legs and sighing very irritated Well I work on Wall Street At Pierce Pierce\\n   A long pause\\n   Have you heard of it I ask\\n   Another long pause Finally Sabrina breaks the silence Is it connected with Mays or Macys\\n   I pause before asking Mays\\n   She thinks about it for a minute then says Yeah A shoe outlet Isnt P P a shoe store\\n   I stare at her hard\\n   Christie stands up surprising me and moves over to admire the stereo You have a really nice place here Paul and then looking through the compact discs hundreds upon hundreds of them stacked and lined up in a large whiteoak shelf all of them alphabetically listed How much did you pay for it\\n   Im standing up to pour myself another glass of the Acacia Actually none of your business Christie but I can assure you it certainlywasntcheap\\n   From the kitchen I notice Sabrina has taken a pack of cigarettes out of her handbag and I walk back into the living room shaking my head before she can light one\\n   No no smoking I tell her Not in here\\n   She smiles pauses slightly and with a little nod slips the cigarette back into its box Im carrying a tray of chocolates with me and I offer one to Christie\\n   Varda truffle\\n   She stares blankly at the plate then politely shakes her head I move over to Sabrina who smiles and takes one and then concerned I notice her wineglass which is still full\\n   I dont want you to get drunk I tell her But thats a very fine chardonnay youre not drinking\\n   I place the tray of trues on the glasstop Palazzetti coffee table and sit back in the armchair motioning for Christie to get back on the couch which she does We sit here silently listening to theLes MisrablesCD Sabrina chews on the truffle thoughtfully and takes another\\n   I have to break the silence again myself So have either of you been abroad It hits me almost immediately what the sentence sounds like how it could be misinterpreted I mean to Europe\\n   Both of them are looking at each other as if some secret signal is passing between them before Sabrina shakes her head and then Christie follows with the same head movement\\n   The next question I ask after another long silence is Did either of you go to college and if so where\\n   The response to this question consists of a barely contained glare from each of them and so I decide to take this as an opportunity to lead them into the bedroom where I make Sabrina dance a little before taking off her clothes in front of Christie and me while every halogen bulb in the bedroom burns I have her put on a Christian Dior lace and charmeuse teddy and then I take off all my clothes except for a pair of Nike allsport sneakers  and Christie eventually takes off the Ralph Lauren robe and is buck naked except for an Angela Cummings silk and latex scarf which I knot carefully around her neck and suede gloves by Gloria Jose from Bergdorf Goodman that I bought on sale\\n   Now the three of us are on the futon Christie is on all fours facing the headboard her ass raised high in the air and Im straddling her back as if I was riding a dog or something but backward my knees resting on the mattress my dick half hard and Im facing Sabrina who is staring into Christies spreadopen ass with a determined expression Her smile seems tortured and shes wetting her own lips by fingering herself and tracing her glistening index finger across them like shes applying lip gloss With both my hands I keep Christies ass and cunt spread open and I urge Sabrina to move in closer and sniff them Sabrina is now face level at Christies ass and cunt both of which Im fingering lightly I motion for Sabrina to move her face in even closer until she can smell my fingers which I push into her mouth and which she sucks on hungrily With my other hand I keep massaging Christies tight wet pussy which hangs heavy soaked below her spread dilated asshole\\n   Smell it I tell Sabrina and she moves in closer until shes two inches an inch away from Christies asshole My dick is standing straight up now and I keep jerking myself off to keep it that way\\n   Lick her cunt first I tell Sabrina and with her own fingers she spreads it open and starts lapping at it like a dog while massaging the clit and then she moves up to Christies asshole which she laps at in the same way Christies moans are urgent and uncontrolled and she starts pushing her ass harder into Sabrinas face onto Sabrinas tongue which Sabrina pushes slowly in and out of Christies asshole While she does this I watch transfixed and start rubbing Christies clit quickly until shes humping onto Sabrinas face and shouts Im coming and while pulling on her own nipples has a long sustained orgasm And though she could be faking it I like the way it looks so I dont slap her or anything\\n   Tired of balancing myself I fail off Christie and lie on my back positioning Sabrinas face over my stiff huge cock which I guide into her mouth with my hand jerking it off while she sucks on the head I pull Christie toward me and while taking her gloves off start kissing her hard on the mouth licking inside it pushing my tongue against hers past hers as far down her throat as it will go She fingers her cunt which is so wet that her upper thighs look like someones slathered something slick and oily all over them I push Christie down past my waist to help Sabrina suck my cock off and after the two of them take turns licking the head and the shaft Christie moves to my balls which are aching and swollen as large as two small plums and she laps at them before placing her mouth over the entire sac alternately massaging and lightly sucking the balls separating them with her tongue Christie moves her mouth back to the cock Sabrinas still sucking on and they start kissing each other hard on the mouth right above the head of my dick drooling saliva onto it and jacking it off Christie keeps masturbating herself this entire time working three fingers in her vagina wetting her clit with her juices moaning This turns me on enough to grab her by the waist and swivel her around and position her cunt over my face which she gladly sits on Clean and pink and wet and spread her clit swollen engorged with blood her cunt hangs over my head and I push my face into it tonguing it craving its flavor while fingering her asshole Sabrina is still working on my cock jacking off the base of it the rest of it filling her mouth and now she moves on top of me her knees resting on either side of my chest and I tear off her teddy so that her ass and cunt are facing Christie whose head I force down and order to lick them suck on that clit and she does\\n   Its an awkward position for all of us so this only goes on for maybe two or three minutes but during this short period Sabrina comes in Christies face while Christie grinding her cunt hard against my mouth comes all over mine and I have to steady her thighs and grip them firmly so she wont break my nose with her humping I still havent come and Sabrinas doing nothing special to my cock so I pull it out of her mouth and have her sit on it My cock slides in almost too easily her cunt is too wet drenched with her own cunt juice and Christies saliva and theres no friction  so I take the scarf from around Christies neck and pull my cock out of Sabrinas cunt and spreading her open wipe her cunt and my cock off and then try to resume fucking her while I continue to eat out Christie who I bring to yet another climax within a matter of minutes The two girls are facing each other  Sabrinas fucking my cock Christies sitting on my face  and Sabrina leans in to suck and finger Christies small firm full tits Then Christie starts Frenchkissing Sabrina hard on the mouth as I continue to eat her out my mouth and chin and jaw covered with her juices which momentarily dry then are replaced by others\\n   I push Sabrina off my cock and lay her on her back her head at the foot of the futon Then I lay Christie over her placing the two in a sixtynine position with Christies ass raised up in the air and with a surprisingly small amount of Vaseline after slipping on a condom finger her tight ass until it relaxes and loosens enough so I can ease my dick into it while Sabrina eats Christies cunt out fingering it sucking on her swollen clit sometimes holding on to my balls and squeezing them lightly teasing my asshole with a moistened finger and then Christie is leaning into Sabrinas cunt and shes roughly spread her legs open as wide as possible and starts digging her tongue into Sabrinas cunt but not for long because shes interrupted by yet another orgasm and she lifts her head up and looks back at me her face slick with cunt juice and she cries out Fuck me Im coming oh god eat me Im coming and this spurs me on to start fucking her ass very hard while Sabrina keeps eating the cunt that hangs over her face which is covered with Christies pussy juice I pull my cock out of Christies ass and force Sabrina to suck on it before I push it back into Christies spread cunt and after a couple of minutes of fucking it I start coming and at the same time Sabrina lifts her mouth off my balls and just before I explode into Christies cunt she spreads my ass cheeks open and forces her tongue up into my asshole which spasms around it and because of this my orgasm prolongs itself and then Sabrina removes her tongue and starts moaning that shes coming too because after Christie finishes coming she resumes eating Sabrinas cunt and I watch hunched over Christie panting as Sabrina lifts her hips repeatedly into Christies face and then I have to lie back spent but still hard my cock glistening still aching from the force of my ejaculation and I close my eyes my knees weak and shaking\\n   I awaken only when one of them touches my wrist accidentally My eyes open and I warn them not to touch the Rolex which Ive kept on during this entire time They lie quietly on either side of me sometimes touching my chest once in a while running their hands over the muscles in my abdomen A half hour later Im hard again I stand up and walk over to the armoire where next to the nail gun rests a sharpened coat hanger a rusty butter knife matches from the Gotham Bar and Grill and a halfsmoked cigar and turning around naked my erection jutting out in front of me I hold these items out and explain in a hoarse whisper Were not through yet An hour later I will impatiently lead them to the door both of them dressed and sobbing bleeding but well paid Tomorrow Sabrina will have a limp Christie will probably have a terrible black eye and deep scratches across her buttocks caused by the coat hanger Bloodstained Kleenex will lie crumpled by the side of the bed along with an empty carton of Italian seasoning salt I picked up at Dean Deluca\\n   Shopping\\n   The colleagues I have to buy presents for include Victor Powell Paul Owen David Van Patten Craig McDermott Luis Carruthers Preston Nichols Connolly OBrien Reed Robison Scott Montgomery Ted Madison Jeff Duvall Boris Cunningham Jamie Conway Hugh Turnball Frederick Dibble Todd Hamlin Muldwyn Butner Ricky Hendricks and George Carpenter and though I could have sent Jean to make these purchases today instead I asked her to sign stamp and mail three hundred designer Christmas cards with a Mark Kostabi print on them and then I wanted her to find out as much as she could about the Fisher account that Paul Owen is handling Right now Im moving down Madison Avenue after spending close to an hour standing in a daze near the bottom of the staircase at the Ralph Lauren store on Seventysecond staring at cashmere sweater vests confused hungry and when I finally took hold of my bearings after failing to get the address of the blond hardbody who worked behind the counter and who was coming on to me I left the store yelling Comeall ye faithfull Now I scowl at a bum huddled in the doorway of a store called EarKarma and hes clutching a sign that reads HUNGRY AND HOMELESS PLEASE HELP ME GOD BLESS and then I find myself moving down

Courtney up to warn her as a joke  but then decided against it deriving a certain amount of satisfaction from imagining Luis Carruthers proposing to her Courtney shyly accepting their nightmarish honeymoon Scowling at another beggar shivering in the misty drizzle at Fiftyseventh and Fifth I walk up and squeeze his cheek affectionately then laugh out loud His eyes how they twinkled His dimples

the Princeton Club at seven I worked out this morning for two hours before the office and though I could have used this time for a massage since my muscles are sore from the exhausting exercise regimen Im now on or a facial even though I had one yesterday there are just too many cocktail parties in the upcoming weeks that Ihaveto attend and my presence at them will put a crimp in my shopping schedule so its best if I get the shopping out of the way now I run into Bradley Simpson from P P outside FAO Schwarz and hes wearing a glenplaid worsted wool suit with notched lapels by Perry Ellis a cotton broadcloth shirt by Gitman Brothers a silk tie by Savoy a chronograph with a crocodileskin band by Breil a cotton raincoat by Paul Smith and a fur felt hat by Paul Stuart After he says Hey Davis I inexplicably start listing the names of all eight reindeer alphabetically and when Ive finished he smiles and says Listen theres a Christmas party at Nekenieh on the twentieth see you there I smile and assure him Ill be at Nekenieh on the twentieth and as I walk off nodding to no one I call back to him Hey asshole I wanna watch you diemotherfuckaaahhh and then I start screaming like a banshee moving across Fiftyeighth banging my Bottega Veneta briefcase against a wall Another choir on Lexington sings Hark the Herald Angels and I tapdance moaning in front of them before I move like a zombie toward Bloomingdales where I rush over to the first tie rack I see and murmur to the young faggot working behind the counter Too too fabulous while fondling a silk ascot He flirts and asks if Im a model Ill see you in hell I tell him and move on\\n   vases and felt fedoras with feather headbands and alligator toiletry cases with giltsilver bottles and brushes and shoehorns that cost two

aftershaves and photo albums and salt and pepper shakers and ceramictoaster cookie jars and twohundreddollar shoehorns and backpacks and aluminum lunch pails and pillow covers\\n   Some kind of existential chasm opens before me while Im browsing in Bloomingdales and causes me to first locate a phone and check my messages then near tears after taking three Halcion since my body has mutated and adapted to the drug it no longer causes sleep it just seems to ward off total madness I head toward the Clinique counter where with my platinum American Express card I buy six tubes of shaving cream while flirting nervously with the girls who work there and I decide this emptiness has at least in part some connection with the way I treated Evelyn at Barcadia the other night though there is always the possibility it could just as easily have somexhing to do with the tracking device on my VCR and while I make a mental note to put in an appearance at Evelyns Christmas party  Im even tempted to ask one of the Clinique girls toescort me  I also remind myself to look through my VCR handbook and deal with the tracking device problem I see a tenyearold girl standing by her mother who is buying a scarf some jewelry and Im thinking Not bad Im wearing a cashmere topcoat a doublebreasted plaid wool and alpaca sport coat pleated wool trousers patterned silk tie all by Valentino Couture and leather laceups by AllenEdmonds\\n   Christmas Party\\n   Im having drinks with Charles Murphy at Rustys to fortify myself before making an appearance at Evelyns Christmas party Im wearing a

bought the Empire State Building and NellsNellscan you believe it Bateman he exclaims over his second Absolut on the rocks and it moves something in me it sets something off and after leaving Rustys while wandering around the Upper West Side I find myself crouched in the doorway of what used to be Carly Simons a very hot J Akail restaurant that closed last fall and leaping out at a passing Japanese delivery boy I knock him off his bicycle and drag him into the doorway his legs tangled somehow in the Schwinn he was riding which works to my advantage since when I slit his throat  easily effortlessly  the spasmodic kicking that usually accompanies this routine is blocked by the bike which he still manages to lift five six times while hes choking on his own hot blood I open the cartons of Japanese food and dump their contents over him but to my surprise instead of sushi and teriyaki and hand rolls and soba noodles chicken with cashew nuts falls all over his gasping bloodied face and beef chow mein and shrimp fried rice and moo shu pork splatter onto his heaving chest and this irritating setback  accidentally killing the wrong type of Asian  moves me to check where this order was going  Sally Rubinstein  and with my Mont Blanc pen to writeIm gonna get you too bitchon the back of it then place the order over the dead kids face and shrug apologetically mumbling Uh sorry and recall thatThe Patty Winters Showthis morning was about Teenage Girls Who Trade Sex for Crack I spent two hours at the gym today and can now complete two hundred abdominal crunches in less than three minutes Near Evelyns brownstone I hand a freezing bum one of the fortune cookies I took from the delivery boy and he stuffs it fortune and all into his mouth nodding thanks Fucking slob I mutter loud enough for him to hear As I turn the corner and head for Evelyns I notice the police lines arestillup around the brownstone where her neighbor Victoria Bell was decapitated Four limousines are parked in front one still running\\n   Im late The living room and dining room are already crowded with people I dont really want to talk to Tall full blue spruces covered with white twinkling lights stand on either side of the fireplace Old Christmas songs from the sixties sung by the Ronettes are on the CD player A bartender in a tuxedo pours champagne and eggnog mixes Manhattans and martinis opens bottles of Calera Jensen pinot noir and a Chappellet chardonnay Twentyyearold ports line a makeshift bar between vases of poinsettias A long folding table has been covered with a red tablecloth and is jammed with pans and plates and bowls of roasted hazelnuts and lobster and oyster bisques and celery root soup with apples and Beluga caviar on toast points and creamed onions and roast goose with chestnut stung and caviar in puff pastry and vegetable tarts with tapenade roast duck and roast rack of veal with shallots and gnocchi gratin and vegetable strudel and Waldorf salad and scallops and bruschetta with mascarpone and white truffles and green chili souffl and roast partridge with sage potatoes and onion and cranberry sauce mincemeat pies and chocolate truffles and lemon souffl tarts and pecan tarte Tatin Candles have been lit everywhere all of them in sterling silver Tiffany candleholders And though I cannot be positive that Im not hallucinating there seem to be midgets dressed in green and red elf suits and felt hats walking around with trays of appetizers I pretend not to have noticed and head straight for the bar where I gulp down a glass of notbad champagne then move over to Donald Petersen and as with most of the men here someone has tied paper antlers to his head On the other side of the room Maria and Darwin Huttons fiveyearold daughter Cassandra is wearing a sevenhundreddollar velvet dress and petticoat by Nancy Halser After finishing a second glass of champagne I move to martinis  Absolut doubles  and after Ive calmed down sufficiently I take a closer look around the roombut the midgets are still there\\n   Too much red I mutter to myself trancing out Its makin me nervous\\n   Hey McCloy Petersen says What do you say\\n   I snap out of it and automatically ask Is this the British cast recording ofLes Misrablesor not\\n   Hey have a holly jolly Christmas He points a finger at me drunk\\n   So whatis this music I ask thoroughly annoyed And by the way sir deck the halls with boughs of holly\\n   Bill Septor he says shrugging I think Septor or Skeptor\\n   Why doesnt she put on some Talking Heads for Christsakes I complain bitterly\\n   Courtney is standing on the other side of the room holding a champagne glass and ignoring me completely\\n   OrLes Miz he suggests\\n   American or British cast recording My eyes narrowing Im testing him\\n   Er British he says as a dwarf hands us each a plate of Waldorf salad\\n   Definitely I murmur staring at the dwarf as he waddles away\\n   Suddenly Evelyn rushes up to us wearing a sable jacket and velvet pants by Ralph Lauren and in one hand shes holding a piece of mistletoe which she places above my head and in the other a candy cane\\n   Mistletoe alert she shrieks kissing me dryly on the cheek Merry Xmas Patrick Merry Xmas Jimmy\\n   Merry Xmas I say unable to push her away since Ive got a martini in one hand and a Waldorf salad in the other\\n   Youre late honey she says\\n   Im not late I say barely protesting\\n   Oh yes you are she says in singsong\\n   Ive been here the entire time I say dismissing her You just didnt see me\\n   Oh stop scowling Youre such a Grinch She turns to Petersen Did you know Patricks the Grinch\\n   Bah humbug I sigh staring over at Courtney\\n   Hell we all know McCloys the Grinch Petersen bellows drunkenly How ya doin Mr Grinch\\n   And what does Mr Grinch want for Christmas Evelyn asks in a babys voice Has Mr Grinchie been a good boy this year\\n   I sigh The Grinch wants a Burberry raincoat a Ralph Lauren cashmere sweater a new Rolex a car stereo\\n   Evelyn stops sucking on the candy cane to interrupt But you donthaveacar honey\\n   I want one anyway I sigh again The Grinch wants a car stereo anyway\\n   Hows the Waldorf salad Evelyn asks worriedly Do you think it tastes all right\\n   Delicious I murmur craning my neck spotting someone suddenly impressed Hey you didnt tell me Laurence Tisch was invited to this party\\n   She turns around What are you talking about\\n   Why I ask is Laurence Tisch passing around a tray of canapes\\n   Oh god Patrick thatsnotLaurence Tisch she says Thats one of the Christmas elves\\n   One of thewhat You mean the midgets\\n   Theyreelves she stresses Santas helpers God what a sourpuss Look at them Theyre adorable That one over there is Rudolph the one passing out candy canes is Blitzen The other one is Donner\\n   Wait a minute Evelyn wait I say closing my eyes holding up the hand with the Waldorf salad in it Im sweating dj vu but why Have I met these elves somewhere Forget about it I those are the names of reindeer Not elves Blitzen was areindeer\\n   The only Jewish one Petersen reminds us\\n   Oh   Evelyn seems bewildered by this information and she looks over at Petersen to confirm this Is this true\\n   He shrugs thinks about it and looks confused Hey baby reindeer elves Grinches brokers Hell whats the difference long as the Cristal flows hey He chuckles nudging me in the ribs Aint that right Mr Grinch\\n   Dont you think its Christmasy she asks hopefully\\n   Oh yes Evelyn I tell her Its very Christmasy and Im truthful not lying\\n   But Mr Sourpuss was late she pouts shaking that damn piece of mistletoe at me accusingly And not a word about the Waldorf salad\\n   You know Evelyn there were a lot of otherXmasparties in this metropolis that I could have attended tonight yet I chose yours Why you might ask Why I asked myself I didnt come up with a feasible answer yet Im here so be you know grateful babe I say\\n   Oh sothisis my Christmas present she asks sarcastic How sweet Patrick how thoughtful\\n   Nothis is I give her a noodle I just noticed was stuck on my shirt cuff Here\\n   Oh Patrick Im going to cry she says dangling the noodle up to candlelight Its gorgeous Can I put it on now\\n   No Feed it to one of the elves That one over there looks pretty hungry Excuse me but I need another drink\\n   I hand Evelyn the plate of Waldorf salad and tweak one of Petersens antlers and head toward the bar humming Silent Night vaguely depressed by what most of the women are wearing pullover cashmere sweaters blazers long wool skirts corduroy dresses turtlenecks Cold weather No hardbodies\\n   Paul Owen is standing near the bar holding a champagne flute studying his antique silver pocket watch from Harnmahcher Schlemmer no doubt and Im about to walk over and mention something about that damned Fisher account when Humphrey Rhinebeck bumps into me trying to avoid stepping on one of the elves and hes still wearing a cashmere chesterfield overcoat by Crombie from Lord Taylor a peaklapeled doublebreasted wool tuxedo a cotton shirt by Perry Ellis a bow tie from Hugo Boss and paper antlers in a way that suggests hes completely unaware and as if by rote the twerp says Hey Bateman last week I brought a new herringbone tweed jacket to my tailor for alterations\\n   Well uh congratulations seem in order I say shaking his hand Thatsnifty\\n   Thanks He blushes looking down Anyway he noticed that the retailer had removed the original label and replaced it with one of his own Now what I want to know is is thislegal\\n   Its confusing I know I say still moving through the crowd Once a line of clothing has been purchased from its manufacturer its perfectly legal for the retailer to replace the original label with his own However itsnotlegal to replace it withanotherretailers label\\n   But wait whyisthat he asks trying to sip from his martini glass while attempting to follow me\\n   Because details regarding fiber content and country of origin or the manufacturers registration number must remainintact Label tampering is very hard to detect and rarely reported I shout over my shoulder Courtney is kissing Paul Owen on the cheek their hands already firmly clasped I stiffen up and stop walking Rhinebeck bumps into me But she moves on waving to someone across the room\\n   So whats the best solution Rhinebeck calls out behind me\\n   Shop for familiar labels from retailers you know and take those fucking antlers off your head Rhinebeck You look like a retard Excuse me I walk off but not before Humphrey reaches up and feels the headpiece Oh mygod\\n   Owen I exclaim merrily holding out a hand the other hand grabbing a martini off a passing elf tray\\n   Marcus Merry Christmas Owen says shaking my hand Howve you been Workaholic I suppose\\n   Havent seen you in a while I say then wink Workaholic huh\\n   Well we just got back from the Knickerbocker Club he says and then greets someone who bumps into him Hey Kinsley  then back to me Were going to Nells Limos out front\\n   We should have lunch I say trying to figure out a way to bring up the Fisher account without being tacky about it\\n   Yes that would be great he says Maybe you could bring \\n   Cecelia I guess\\n   Yes Cecelia he says\\n   OhCeceliawould adore it I say\\n   Well lets do it He smiles\\n   Yes We could go to Le Bernardin I say then after pausing for someseafoodperhaps Hmmm\\n   Le Bernardin is in Zagats top ten this year He nods You know that\\n   We could have some I pause again staring at him then more deliberately fishthere No\\n   Sea urchins Owen says scanning the room Meredith loves the sea urchins there\\n   Oh does she I ask nodding\\n   Meredith he calls out motioning for someone behind me Come here\\n   SheshereIask\\n   Shes talking to Cecilia over there he says Meredith he calls out waving I turn around Meredith and Evelyn make their way over to us\\n   I whirl around back to Owen\\n   Meredith walks over with Evelyn Meredith is wearing a beaded wool gabardine dress and bolero by Geoffrey Beene from Barneys diamond and gold earrings by James Savitt  gloves by Geoffrey Beene for Portolano products and she says Yes boys What are you two talking about Making up Christmas lists\\n   The sea urchins at Le Bernardin darling Owen says\\n   Myfavorite topic Meredith drapes an arm over my shoulder while she confides to me as an aside Theyre fabulous\\n   Delectable I cough nervously\\n   What does everyone think of the Waldorf salad Evelyn asks Did you like it\\n   Cecelia darling I havent tried it yet Owen says recognizing someone across the room But Id like to know why Laurence Tisch is serving the eggnog\\n   ThatsnotLaurence Tisch Evelyn whines genuinely upset Thats a Christmas elfPatrick what did you tell him\\n   Nothing I say Cecelia\\n   Besides Patrick youre theGrinch\\n   At the mentions of my name I immediately start blabbering hoping that Owen didnt notice WellCecelia I told him I thought it was a you know a mixture of the two like a I stop briefly look at them before lamely spitting out a ChristmasTisch Then nervously I lift a sprig of parsley off a slice of pheasant pt that a passing elf is carrying and hold it over Evelyns head before she can say anything Mistletoe alert I shout and people around us are suddenly ducking and then I kiss her on the lips while looking at Owen and Meredith both of them staring at me strangely and out of the corner ofmy eye I catch Courtney who is talking to Rhinebeck gazing at me hatefully outraged\\n   Oh Patrick Evelyn starts\\n   Cecelia Come here at once I pull her arm then tell Owen and Meredith Excuse us We have to talk to that elf and get this all straightened out\\n   Im so sorry she says to the two of them shrugging helplessly as I drag her away Patrick what is going on\\n   I maneuver her into the kitchen\\n   Patrick she asks What are we doing in thekitchen\\n   Listen I tell her grabbing her shoulders facing her Lets get out of here\\n   Oh Patrick she sighs I cant just leave Arent you having a good time\\n   Whycant you leave I ask Is it so unreasonable Youve been here long enough\\n   Patrick this ismyChristmas party she says Besides the elves are going to sing O Tannenbaum any minute now\\n   Come on Evelyn Lets just get out of here Im on the verge of hysteria panicked that Paul Owen or worse Marcus Halberstam is going to walk into the kitchen I want to take you away from all this\\n   From allwhat she asks then her eyes narrow You didnt like the Waldorf salad did you\\n   I want to take you away fromthis I say motioning around the kitchen spastic From sushi and elves andstuff\\n   An elf walks into the kitchen setting down a tray of dirty plates and past himoverhim I can see Paul Owen leaning into Meredith whos shouting something into his ear over the din of Christmas music and he scans the room looking for someone nodding then Courtney walks into view and I grab Evelyn bringing her even closer to me\\n   Sushi Elves Patrick youre confusingme Evelyn says And Idontappreciate it\\n   Letsgo Im squeezing her roughly pulling her toward the back door Lets be daring for once For just once in your life Evelyn be daring\\n   She stops refusing to be pulled along and then she starts smiling considering my offer but only slightly won over\\n   Come on I start whining Let this bemyChristmas present\\n   Oh ho I was already at Brooks Brothers and she starts\\n   Stop it Come on I want this I say and then in a last desperate attempt I smile flirtatiously kissing her lightly on the lips and add Mrs Batsman\\n   Oh Patrick she sighs melting But what about cleanup\\n   The midgetsll do it I assure her\\n   But someone has to oversee it honey\\n   So choose an elf Make that one over there the elf overseer I say But lets gonow I start pulling her toward the back door of the brownstone her shoes squeaking as they slide across the Muscoli marble tile\\n   And then were out the door rushing down the alley adjacent to the brownstone and I stop and peer around the corner to see if anyone we know is leaving or entering the party We make a run for a limousine I think is Owens but I dont want to make Evelyn suspicious so I simply walk up to the closest one open the door and push her in\\n   Patrick she squeals pleased This is so naughtyAnda limo I close the door on her and walk around the car and knock on the drivers window The driver unrolls it\\n   Hi I say holding out a hand Pat Bateman\\n   The driver just stares an unlit cigar clenched in his mouth first at my outstretched hand then at my face then at the top of my head\\n   Pat Bateman I repeat What ah what is it\\n   He keeps looking at me Tentatively I touch my hair to see if its messed up or out of place and to my shock and surprise I feel two pairs of paper antlers There arefourantlers on myfucking headI mutter Oh Jesus whoa and tear them off staring at them crumpled in my hands horrified I throw them on the ground then turn back to the driver\\n   So Pat Bateman I say smoothing my hair back into place\\n   Uh yeah Sid He shrugs\\n   Listen Sid Mr Owen says we can take this car so I stop my breath steaming in the frozen air\\n   Whos Mr Owen Sid asks\\n   PaulOwen You know I say Your customer\\n   No This is Mr Barkers limo he says Nice antlers though\\n   Shit I say running around the limo to get Evelyn out of there before something bad happens but its too late The second I open the door Evelyn sticks her head out and squeals Patrick darling IloveitChampagne she holds up a bottle of Cristal in one hand and a gold box in the other  andtruffles too\\n   I grab her arm and yank her out mumbling by way of an explanation under my breath Wrong limo take the truffles and we head over to the next limousine I open the door and guide Evelyn in then move around to the front and knock on the drivers window He unrolls it He looks exactly like the other driver\\n   Hi Pat Batsman  I say holding out my hand\\n   Yeah Hi Donald Trump My wife Ivanas in the back he says sarcastically taking it\\n   Hey watch it I warn Listen Mr Owen says we can take his car Im oh damn I mean Im Marcus\\n   You just said your name was Pat\\n   No I was wrong I say sternly staring directly at him I was wrong about my name being Pat My name is Marcus Marcus Halberstam\\n   Now youre sure of this right he asks\\n   Listen Mr Owen said I can take his car for the night so I stop You know lets just get on with it\\n   I think I should talk to Mr Owen first the driver says amused toying with me\\n   No wait I say then calming down Listen Im its fine really I start chuckling to myself Mr Owen is in a veryvery bad mood\\n   Im not supposed to do this the driver says without looking up at me Its totally illegal No way Give it up\\n   Oh come on man I say\\n   Its totally against company regulations he says\\n   Fuck company regulations I bark out at him\\n   Fuck company regulations he asks nodding smiling\\n   Mr Owen says itsokay I say Maybe youre not listening\\n   Nope No can do He shakes his head\\n   I pause stand up straight run a hand over my face breathe in and then lean back down Listen to me I breathe in again Theyve got midgets in there I point with a thumb back at the brownstone Midgets who are about to sing O Tannenbaum I look at him imploringly begging for sympathy at the same time looking appropriately frightened Do you know how scary that is Elves I gulp  harmonizing I pause then quickly ask Think about it\\n   Listen mister\\n   Marcus I remind him\\n   Marcus Whatever Im not gonna break the rules I cant do anything about it Its company rules Im not gonna break em\\n   We both lapse into silence I sigh look around considering dragging Evelyn to the third limo or maybe back to Barkers limo hes a real asshole  butno goddamnitI wantOwensMeanwhile the driver sighs to himself If the midgets want to sing let them sing\\n   Shit I curse taking out my gazelleskin wallet Heres a hundred I hand him two fifties\\n   Two hundred he says\\n   This city sucks I mutter handing the money over\\n   Where do you want to go he asks taking the bills with a sigh as he starts the limousine\\n   Club Chernoble I say rushing to the back and opening the door\\n   Yessir he shouts\\n   I hop in shutting the door just as the driver peels away from Evelyns brownstone toward Riverside Drive Evelyns sitting next to me while Im catching my breath wiping cold sweat off my brow with an Armani handkerchief When I look over at her shes on the verge of tears her lips trembling silent for once\\n   Youre startling me What happened I am alarmed What what did I do The Waldorf salad was good What else\\n   Oh Patrick she sighs Its lovely I dont know what to say\\n   Well I pause carefully I dont either\\n   This she says presenting me with a diamond necklace from Tiffanys Merediths present from Owen Well help me put it on darling Youre not the Grinch honey\\n   Uh Evelyn I say then curse under my breath as she turns her back toward me so I can clasp it around her neck The limousine lurches forward and she falls against me laughing then kisses my cheek Its lovely oh I love it Oops must have true breath Sorry honey Find me some champagne and pour me a glass\\n   But I stare helplessly at the glittering necklace Thats not it\\n   What Evelyn asks looking around the limo Are there glasses in here Whats not it honey\\n   Thats not it Im speaking in monotone\\n   Oh honey She smiles You have something else for me\\n   No I mean\\n   Come on you devil she says playfully grabbing at my coat pocket Come on what is it\\n   What iswhat I ask calmly annoyed\\n   Youve got something else Let me guess A ring to match she guesses A matching bracelet AbroochSo thats itl She claps her hands Its a matching brooch\\n   While Im trying to push her away from me holding one of her arms back the other snakes behind me and grabs something out of my pocket another fortune cookie I lifted from the dead Chinese boy She stares at it puzzled for a moment and says Patrick youre so romantic and then studying the fortune cookie and with less enthusiasm so original\\n   Im also staring at the fortune cookie Its got a lot of blood on it and I shrug and say as jovially as I can Oh you know me\\n   But whats on it She holds it up close to her face peering at it Whats this red stuff\\n   Thats I peer also pretending to be intrigued by the stains then I grimace Thats sweet n sour sauce\\n   She cracks it open excitedly then studies the fortune confused\\n   What does it say I sigh fooling around with the radio then scanning the limo for Owens briefcase wondering where the champagne could possibly be the open box from Tiffanys empty empty on the floor suddenly overwhelmingly depressing me\\n   It says She pauses then squints at it closely rereading it It saysThe fresh grilled joie gras at Le Cirque is excellent but the lobster salad is only soso\\n   Thats nice I murmur looking for champagne glasses tapes anything\\n   It really says this Patrick She hands me the fortune a slight smile creeping up on her face that I can make out even in the darkness of the limo What could it possibly mean she asks slyly\\n   I take it from her read it then look at Evelyn then back at the fortune then out the tinted window at snow flurries swirling around lampposts around people waiting for buses beggars staggering directionless down city streets and I say out loud to myself My luck could be worse It really could\\n   Oh honey she says throwing her arms around me hugging my head Lunch at Le Cirque Youre the best Youre not the Grinch I take it back Thursday Is Thursday good for you Oh no I cant do it Thursday Herbal wrap But hows Friday And do we really want to go to La Cirque How about\\n   I push her off me and knock on the divider rapping my knuckles against it loudly until the driver lowers it Sid I mean Earle whoever this isnt the way to Chernoble\\n   Yes it is Mr Bateman\\n   Hey\\n   I mean MrHalberstamAvenue C right He coughs politely\\n   I suppose I say staring out the window I dont recognize anything\\n   Avenue C Evelyn looks up from marveling at the necklace Paul Owen bought Meredith Whats Avenue C C as in Cartier I take it\\n   Its hip I assure her Its totally hip\\n   Have you been there she asks\\n   Millions of times I mutter\\n   Chernoble NonotChernoble  she whines Honey itsChristmas\\n   What in the hell doesthatmean I ask\\n   Limo driver oh limo driver Evelyn leans forward balancing herself on my knees Limo driver were going to the Rainbow Room Driver to the Rainbow Room please\\n   I push her back and lean forward Ignore her Chernoble ASAP I press the button and the divider goes back up\\n   Oh Patrick ItsChristmas she whines\\n   You keep saying that as if itmeanssomething I say staring right at her\\n   But itsChristmas she whines again\\n   I cantstandthe Rainbow Room I say adamant\\n   Oh whynotPatrick she whines They have thebest Waldorf salad in town at the Rainbow Room Did you like mine Did you like my Waldorf salad honey\\n   Oh my god I whisper covering my face with both heads\\n   Honestly Did you she asks The only thing I really worried about wasthat and the chestnut stuffing She pauses Well because the chestnut stuffing was well gross you know\\n   I dont want to go to the Rainbow Room I interrupt my hands still covering my face because I cant score drugs there\\n   Oh She looks me over disapprovingly Tsk tsk tsk Drugs Patrick What kind of ahem drugs are we talking about\\n   Drugs Evelyn CocaineDrugs I want to do some cocaine tonight Do you understand I sit up and glare at her\\n   Patrick she says shaking her head as if shes lost faith in me\\n   I can see youre confused I point out\\n   I just dont want any part of it she says\\n   You dont have to do any of it I tell her Maybe youre not even invited to do any of it\\n   I just dont understand why you have to ruin this time of year for me she says\\n   Think of it asfrostAs Christmas frost As expensive Christmasfrost I say\\n   Well she says lighting up Its kind of exciting to slum isnt it\\n   Thirty bucks at the doorapiece is not exactly slumming Evelyn Then I ask suspiciously Why wasnt Donald Trump invited to your party\\n   Not Donald Trumpagain Evelyn moans Oh god Is that why you were acting like such a buffoon This obsession hasgot to end she practically shouts Thats why you were acting like such an ass\\n   It was the Waldorf salad Evelyn I say teeth clenched It was the Waldorf salad that was making me act like an ass\\n   Oh my god You mean it too She throws her head back in despair I knew it I knew it\\n   But you didnt even make it I scream It wascatered\\n   Oh god she wails I cant believe it\\n   The limousine pulls up in front of Club Chernoble where a crowd ten deep waits standing outside the ropes in the snow Evelyn and I get out and using Evelyn much to her chagrin as a blocker I push my way through the crowd and luckily spot someone who looks exactly like Jonathan Leatherdale about to be let in and really shoving Evelyn whos still holding on to her Christmas present I call out to him Jonathan hey Leatherdale and suddenly predictably the whole crowd starts shouting Jonathan hey Jonathan He spots me as he turns around and calls out Hey Baxter and winks giving me the thumbsup sign but its not to me its to someone else Evelyn and I pretend were with his party anyway The doorman closes the ropes on us asks You two come in that limo He looks over at the curb and motions with his head\\n   Yes Evelyn and I both nod eagerly\\n   Youre in he says lifting the ropes\\n   We walk in and I lay out sixty dollars not a single drink ticket The club is predictably dark except for the flashing strobe lights and even with them all I can really see is dry ice pumping out of a fog machine and one hardbody dancing to INXSs New Sensation which blasts out of speakers at a pitch that vibrates the body I tell Evelyn to go to the bar and get us two glasses of champagne Oh of course she shouts back heading tentatively toward one thin white strip of neon the only light illuminating what might be a place where alcohol is served In the meantime I score a gram from someone who looks like Mike Donaldson and after debating for ten minutes while checking out this hardbody whether I should ditch Evelyn or not she comes up with two flutes half full of champagne indignant sadfaced Its Korbel she shouts Letsleave I shake my head negative and shout back Lets go to the rest rooms She follows\\n   The one bathroom at Chernoble is unisex Two other couples are already there one of them in the only stall The other couple is like us impatiently waiting for the stall to empty The girl is wearing a silk jersey halter top a silk chiffon skirt and silk slingbacks all by Ralph Lauren Her boyfriend is wearing a suit tailored by I think William Fioravanti or Vincent Nicolosi or Scali some wop Both are holding champagne glasses his full hers empty Its quiet except for the sniffling and muted laughter coming from the stall and the bathrooms door is thick enough to block out the music except for the deep thumping drumbeat The guy taps his foot expectantly The girl keeps sighing and tossing her hair over her shoulder in these strangely enticing jerky head movements then she looks over at Evelyn and me and whispers something to her boyfriend Finally after she whispers something to him again he nods and they leave\\n   Thankgod I whisper fingering the gram in my pocket then to Evelyn Why are you so quiet\\n   The Waldorf salad she murmurs not looking at me Damnit\\n   Theres a click the door to the stall opens and a young couple the guy wearing a doublebreasted wool cavalry twill suit cotton shirt and silk tie all by Givenchy the girl wearing a silk taffeta dress with ostrich hem by Geoffrey Beene vermeil earrings by Stephen Dweck Moderne and Chanel grosgrain dance shoes  walks out discreetly wiping each others noses staring at themselves in the mirror before leaving the rest room and just as Evelyn and I are about to walk into the stall theyve vacated the first couple rushes back in and attempts to overtake it\\n   Excuse me I say my arm outstretched blocking the entrance Youleft Its uh our turn you know\\n   Uh no I dont think so the guy says mildly\\n   Patrick Evelyn whispers behind me Let them you know\\n   Wait No Itsour turn I say\\n   Yeah butwewere waiting first\\n   Listen I dontwantto start a fight\\n   But youare the girlfriend says bored yet still managing a sneer\\n   Oh my Evelyn murmurs behind me

arguing about this one of us could beinthere\\n   Yeah I say Us\\n   Oh Christ the girl says hands on hips then to Evelyn and me I cant believe who theyre letting in now\\n   Youare a bitch I murmur disbelieving Your attitudesucks you know that\\n   Evelyn gasps and squeezes my shoulder Patrick\\n   The guy has already started snorting his coke spooning the powder out of a brown vial inhaling then laughing after each hit leaning against the door\\n   Your girlfriends atotalbitch I tell the guy\\n   Patrick Evelyn says Stop it\\n   Shes a bitch I say pointing at her\\n   Patrick apologize Evelyn says\\n   The guy goes into hysterics his head thrown back sniffing in loudly then he doubles up and tries to catch his breath\\n   Oh mygod Evelyn says appalled Why are you laughingDefend her\\n   Why the guy asks then shrugs both nostrils ringed with white powder Hesright\\n   Im leaving Daniel the girl says near tears I cant handlethis I cant handleyou I cant handlethemI warned you at Bice\\n   Go ahead the guy says Go Just do it Take a hike I dont care\\n   Patrick what have you started Evelyn asks backing away from me This is unacceptable and then looking up at the fluorescent bulbs And so is this lighting Im leaving But she stands there waiting\\n   Im leaving Daniel the girl says Did youhear me\\n   Goahead Forget it Daniel says staring at his nose in the mirror waving her away I said take a hike\\n   Im using the stall I tell the room Is this okay Does anybody mind\\n   Arent you going to defend your girlfriend Evelyn asks Daniel\\n   Jesus what do you want me to do He looks at her in the mirror wiping his nose sniffing again I bought her dinner I introduced her to Richard Marx Jesus Christ what else does she want\\n   Beat the shit out of him the girl suggests pointing at me\\n   Oh honey I say shaking my head the things I could do to you with a coat hanger\\n   Goodbye Daniel she says pausing dramatically Im out of here\\n   Good Daniel says holding up the vial More for moi\\n   And dont try calling me she screams opening the door My answering machine is on tonight and Im screening all calls\\n   Patrick Evelyn says still composed prim Ill be outside\\n   I wait a moment staring at her from inside the stall then at the girl standing in the doorway Yeahso\\n   Patrick Evelyn says dont say something youll regret\\n   Justgo I say Just leave Take the limo\\n   Patrick\\n   Leave I roar The Grinch saysleave\\n   I slam the door of the stall and start shoveling the coke from the envelope into my nose with my platinum AmEx In between my gasps I hear Evelyn leave sobbing to the girl Hemademe walk out of my own Christmas party can you believe it My Christmas party And I hear the girl sneer Get a life and I start laughing raucously banging my head against the side of the stall and then I hear the guy do a couple more hits then he splits and after finishing most of the gram I peek out from over the stall to see if Evelyns still hanging around pouting chewing her lower lip sorrowfully ohboo hoo hoobaby but she hasnt come back and then I get an image of Evelyn and Daniels girlfriend on a bed somewhere with the girl spreading Evelyns legs Evelyn on all fours licking her asshole fingering her cunt and this makes me dizzy and I head out of the rest room into the club horny and desperatelusting for contact\\n   But its later now and the crowd has changed its now filled with more punk rockers blacks fewer Wall Street guys more bored rich girls from Avenue A lounging around and the music has changed instead of Belinda Carlisle singing I Feel Free its some black guyrapping if Im hearing this correctly something called Her Shit on His Dick and I sidle up to a couple of hardbody rich girls both of them wearing skanky Betsey Johnsontype dresses and Im wired beyond belief and I start off with a line like Cool music havent I seen you at Salomon Brothers and one of them one of these girls sneers and says Go back to Wall Street and the one with thenose ringsays Fucking yuppie\\n   And they say this even though my suit looks black in the darkness of the club and my tie paisley Armani silk  is loosened\\n   Hey I say grinding my teeth You may think Im a really disgusting yuppie but Im notreally I tell them swallowing rapidly wired out of my head\\n   Two black guys are sitting with them at the table Both sport faded jeans Tshirts and leather jackets One has reflector sunglasses on the other has a shaved head Both are glaring at me I stick out my hand at a crooked angle trying to mimic a rapper Hey I say Im fresh The freshest yknow like uh def the deffest I take a sip of champagne You knowdef\\n   To prove this I spot a black guy with dreadlocks and I walk up to him and exclaim Rasta Man and hold out my hand anticipating a highfive But the nigger just stands there\\n   I mean I cough  Mon and then with less enthusiasm We be uh jamming\\n   He brushes past me shaking his head I look back at the girls They shake their heads a warning to me not to come back over I turn my gaze to a hardbody whos dancing by herself next to a column then I finish my champagne and walk up to her asking for a phone number She smiles Exit\\n   Nells\\n   Midnight Im sitting in a booth at Nells with Craig McDermott and Alex Taylor who has just passed out  and three models from Elite Libby Daisy and Caron Its nearing summer midMay but the club is airconditioned and cool the music from the light jazz band drifts through the halfempty room ceiling fans are whirring a crowd twenty deep waits outside in the rain a surging mass Libby is blond and wearing black grosgrain highheeled evening shoes with exaggeratedly pointed toes and red satin bows by Yves Saint Laurent Daisy is blonder and wearing black satin taperedtoe pumps set off by splatteredsilver sheer black stockings by Betsey Johnson Caron is platinum blond and wearing stackheeled leather boots with a pointed patentleather toe and wool tweed turnedover calf by Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel All three of them have on skimpy black woolknit dresses by Giorgio di SantAngelo and are drinking champagne with cranberry juice and peach schnapps and smoking German cigarettes  but I dont complain even though I think it would be in Nells best interest if a nonsmoking section was initiated Two of them are wearing Giorgio Armani sunglasses Libby has jet lag Of the three Daisy is the only one I even remotely want to fuck Earlier in the day after a meeting with my lawyer about some bogus rape charges I had an anxiety attack in Dean Deluca which I worked off at Xclusive Then I met the models for drinks at the Trump Plaza This was followed by a French movie that I completely did not understand but it was fairly chic anyway then dinner at a sushi restaurant called Vivids near Lincoln Center and a party at one of the models exboyfriends loft in Chelsea where bad fruity sangria was served Last night I had dreams that were lit like pornography and in them I fucked girls made of cardboardThe Patty Winters Showthis morning was about Aerobic Exercise\\n   Im wearing a twobutton wool suit with pleated trousers by Luciano Soprani a cotton shirt by Brooks Brothers and a silk tie by Armani McDermotts got on this wool suit by Lubiam with a linen pocket square by Ashear Bros a Ralph Lauren cotton shirt and a silk tie by Christian Dior and hes about to toss a coin to see which one of us is going downstairs to fetch the Bolivian Marching Powder sinceneitherone of us wants to sit here in the booth with the girls because though we probably want to fuck them we dont want to in factcantweve found out talk to them not even condescendingly they simply havenothingto say and I mean I know we shouldnt be surprised by this but still its somewhat disorienting Taylor is sitting up but his eyes are closed his mouth slightly open and though McDermott and I originally thought he was protesting the girls lack of verbal skills by pretending to be asleep it dawns on us that perhaps hes authentically shitfaced hes been near incoherent since the three sakes he downed at Vivids but none of the girls pay any attention except maybe Libby since shes sitting next to him but its doubtful very doubtful\\n   Heads heads heads I mutter under my breath\\n   McDermott flips the quarter\\n   Tails tails tails he chants then he slaps his hand over the coin after it lands on his napkin\\n   Heads heads heads I hiss praying\\n   He lifts his palm Its tails he says looking at me\\n   I stare at the quarter for a long time before asking Do it again\\n   So long he says looking over at the girls before getting up then he glances at me rolls his eyes gives his head a curt shake Listen he reminds me I want another martini Absolut Double No olive\\n   Hurry I call after him then under my breath watching as he waves gaily from the top of the stairs Fucking moron\\n   I turn back to the booth Behind us a table of Eurotrash hardbodies that suspiciously resemble Brazilian transvestites shriek in unison Lets see Saturday night Im going to a Mets game with Jeff Harding and Leonard Davis Im renting Rambo movies on Sunday The new Lifecycle will be delivered on Monday I stare at the three models for an agonizing amount of time minutes before saying anything noticing that someone has ordered a plate of papaya slices and someone else a plate of asparagus though both remain untouched Daisy carefully looks me over then aims her mouth in my direction and blows smoke toward my head exhaling and it floats over my hair missing my eyes which are protected anyway by the Oliver Peoples nonprescription redwoodframed glasses Ive been wearing most of the night Another one Libby the bimbo with jet lag is trying to figure out how to unfold her napkin My frustration level is surprisingly low because things could be worse After all these could beEnglishgirls We could be drinking  tea\\n   So I say clapping my hands together trying to seem alert It was hot out today No\\n   Where did Greg go Libby asks noticing McDermotts absence\\n   Well Gorbachev is downstairs I tell her McDermott Greg is going to sign a peace treaty with him between the United States and Russia I pause trying to gauge her reaction before adding McDermotts the one behind glasnost you know\\n   Well yeah she says her voice impossibly toneless nodding But he told me he was in mergers and aquasessions\\n   Im looking over at Taylor whos still sleeping I snap one of his suspenders but theres no reaction no movement then I turn back to Libby Youre not confused are you\\n   No she says shrugging Not really\\n   Gorbachevs not downstairs Caron says suddenly\\n   Are you lying Daisy asks smiling\\n   Im thinking Oh boy Yes Carons right Gorbachevs not downstairs Hes at Tunnel Excuse me Waitress I grab at a passing hardbody whos wearing a Bill Blass navy lace gown with a silk organza ruffle Ill have a JB on the rocks and a butcher knife or something sharp from the kitchen Girls\\n   None of them say anything The waitress is staring at Taylor I look over at him then back at the hardbody waitress then back at Taylor Bring him the um grapefruit sorbet and oh lets say a Scotch okay\\n   The waitress just stares at him\\n   Ahem honey I wave my hand in front of her face JB On the rocks I tell her enunciating over the jazz band who are in the middle of a fine rendition of Take Five\\n   She finally nods\\n   And bring them I gesture toward the girls  whatever it was theyre drinking Ginger ale Wine cooler\\n   No Libby says Its champagne She points then says to Caron Right\\n   I guess Caron shrugs\\n   With peach schnapps Daisy reminds her\\n   Champagne I repeat to the waitress With uhhuh peach schnapps Catch that\\n   Waitress nods writes something down leaves and Im checking out her ass as she walks away then I look back at the three of them studying each one very carefully for any signs a flicker of betrayal that would cross their faces the one gesture that would give away this robot act but its fairly dark in Nells and my hope that this is the case  is just wishful thinking and so I clap my hands together again and breathe in So It was really hot out today Right\\n   I need a new fur Libby sighs staring into her champagne\\n   Full length or ankle length Daisy asks in the same tonelow voice\\n   A stole Caron suggests\\n   Either a full length or Libby stops and thinks hard for a minute I saw this short cuddly wrap\\n   But mink right Daisy asks Definitelymink\\n   Oh yeah Mink Libby says\\n   Hey Taylor I whisper nudging him Wake up Theyre talking Youve gotta see this\\n   Butwhichkind Carons on a roll\\n   Dont you find some minks are too fluffy Daisy asks\\n   Some minksaretoo fluffy Libby this time\\n   Silver fox isvery popular Daisy murmurs\\n   Beige tones are also increasingly popular Libby says\\n   Which ones are those someone asks\\n   Lynx Chinchilla Ermine Beaver\\n   Hello Taylor wakes up blinking Im here\\n   Go back to sleep Taylor I sigh\\n   Wheres Mr McDermott he asks stretching\\n   Wandering around downstairs Looking for coke I shrug Silver fox is very popular one of them says\\n   Raccoon Fitch Squirrel Muskrat Mongolian lamb\\n   Am I dreaming Taylor asks me or am I really hearing an actual conversation\\n   Well I suppose what passes for one I wince Shhh Listen Its inspiring\\n   At the sushi restaurant tonight McDermott in a state of total frustration asked the girls if they knew the names of any of the nine planets Libby and Caron guessed the moon Daisy wasnt sure but she actually guessed Comet Daisy thought that Comet was a planet Dumbfounded McDermott Taylor and I all assured her that it was\\n   Well its easy to find a good fur now Daisy says slowly Since more readytowear designers have now entered the fur field the range increases because each designer selects different pelts to give his collection an individual character\\n   Its all so scary Caron says shivering\\n   Dont be intimidated Daisy says Fur is only an accessoryDontbe intimidated by it\\n   But a luxurious accessory Libby points out\\n   I ask the table Has anyone ever played around with a TEC ninemillimeter Uzi Its a gun No Theyre particularly useful because this model has a threaded barrel for attaching silencers and barrel extensions I say this nodding\\n   Furs shouldnt be intimidating Taylor looks over at me and blankly says Im gradually uncovering some startling information here\\n   But a luxurious accessory Libby points out again\\n   The waitress reappears setting the drinks down along with a bowl of grapefruit sorbet Taylor looks at it and says blinking I didnt order this\\n   Yes you did I tell him In your sleep you ordered this You ordered this in your sleep\\n   No I didnt he says unsure\\n   Ill eat it I say Jjust listen Im tapping my fingers against the table loudly\\n   Karl Lagerfeld hands down Libbys saying\\n   Why Caron\\n   He created the Fendi collection of course Daisy says lighting a cigarette\\n   I like the Mongolian lamb mixed with mole or Caron stops to giggle  this black leather jacket lined with Persian lamb\\n   What do you think of Geoffrey Beene Daisy asks her\\n   Caron ponders this The white satin collars iffy\\n   But he doesmarvelous things with Tibetan lambs Libby says\\n   Carolina Herrera Caron asks\\n   No no too fluffy Daisy says shaking her head\\n   Too schoolgirl Libby agrees\\n   James Galanos has the most wonderful Russian lynx bellies though Daisy says\\n   And dont forget Arnold Scaasi The white ermine Libby says Todiefor\\n   Really I smile and lift my lips into a depraved grin To die for\\n   To die for Libby says again affirmative about something for the first time all night\\n   I think youd look adorable in oh a Geoffrey Beene Taylor I whine in a high faggy voice flopping a limp wrist on his shoulder but hes sleeping again so it doesnt matter I remove the hand with a sigh\\n   Thats Miles Caron peers over at some aging gorilla in the next booth with a graying crew cut and an elevenyearold bimbo balanced on his lap\\n   Libby turns around to make sure But I thought he was filming that Vietnam movie in Philadelphia\\n   No ThePhilippines Caron says It wasnt in Philadelphia\\n   Oh yeah Libby says then Are you sure\\n   Yeah In fact its over Caron says in a tone thats completely undecided She blinks In fact its out She blinks again In fact I think it came out last year\\n   The two of them are looking over at the next booth disinterestedly but when they turn back to our table their eyes falling on the sleeping Taylor Caron turns to Libby and sighs Should we go over and say hello\\n   Libby nods slowly her features quizzical in the candlelight and stands up Excuse us They leave Daisy stays sips Carons champagne I imagine her naked murdered maggots burrowing feasting on her stomach tits blackened by cigarette burns Libby eating this corpse out then I clear my throat So it was really hot out today wasnt it\\n   It was she agrees\\n   Ask me a question I tell her feeling suddenly well spontaneous\\n   She inhales on the cigarette then blows out So what do you do\\n   What do you think I do And frisky too\\n   A model She shrugs An actor\\n   No I say Flattering but no\\n   Well\\n   Im into oh murders and executions mostly It depends I shrug\\n   Do you like it she asks unfazed\\n   Um It depends Why I take a bite of sorbet\\n   Well most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions dont really like it she says\\n   Thatsnotwhat I said I say adding a forced smile finishing my JB Oh forget it\\n   Askme a question she says\\n   Okay Where do you I stop for a moment stuck then summer\\n   Maine she says Ask me something else\\n   Where do you work out\\n   Private trainer she says How about you\\n   Xclusive I say On the Upper West Side\\n   Really She smiles then notices someone behind me but her expression doesnt change and her voice remains fiat Francesca Oh my god Its Francesca Look\\n   Daisy And Patrick youdevil Francesca screeches Daisy what in gods name are you doing with astudlike Batman She overtakes the booth sliding in with this bored blond girl I dont recognize Francesca is wearing a velvet dress by Saint Laurent Rive Gauche and the girl I dont recognize is wearing a wool dress by Geoffrey Beene Both are wearing pearls\\n   Hello Francesca I say\\n   Daisy oh my god Ben and JerryshereIloveBen and Jerry I think is what she says all in a breathless rush shouting over the light din actually drowning out the light din  of the jazz band Dont youloveBen and Jerry she asks her eyes wide and then she rasps out to a passing waitress Orangejuice I needorangejuice Jesus fucking Christ the help here hasgotto go Wheres Nell Ill tell her she mutters looking around the room then turns to Daisy Hows my face BatemanBen and JerryarehereDont sit there like an idiot Oh god Im kidding I adore Patrick but come on Batman look lively you stud Ben and Jerry are here She winks lasciviously then wets both lips with her tongue Francesca writes forVanity Fair\\n   But I already I stop and look down at my sorbet troubled I already ordered this grapefruit sorbet Gloomily I point at the dish confused I dont want any ice cream\\n   For Christ sakes BatemanJaggeris here Mick JerryYou know Francesca says talking to the booth but constantly scanning the room Daisys expression hasnt changed once all evening What a yuppie she spells to the blond girl then Francescas eyes land on my sorbet I pull it toward me protectively\\n   Oh yeah I say  Just another night just another night with you I sing sort of I know who he is\\n   You look thin Daisy youre making me sick Anyway this is Alison Poole who is also too thin and makes me sick Francesca says lightly slapping my hands covering the sorbet pulling the dish back toward her And this is Daisy Milton and Patrick\\n   Weve met Alison says glaring at me\\n   Hi Alison Pat Bateman I say holding out my hand\\n   Wevemet she says again glaring harder\\n   Uh we have I ask\\n   Francesca screams God look at that profile of Batemans TotallyRomanAnd thoselashes she shrieks\\n   Daisy smiles approvingly I play it cool ignoring them\\n   I recognize Alison as a girl I did last spring while at the Kentucky Derby with Evelyn and her parents I remember she screamed when I tried to push my entire arm gloved and slathered with Vaseline toothpaste anything I could find up into her vagina She was drunk wasted on coke and I had tied her up with wire slapped duct tape all over her mouth her face her breasts Francesca has given me head before I dont remember the place or when but shes given me head and liked it I suddenly remember painfully that I would have liked to see Alison bleed to death that afternoon last spring but something stopped me She was so high oh my god she kept moaning during those hours blood bubbling out of her nose  she never wept Maybe that was the problem maybe that was what saved her I won a lot of money that weekend on a horse called Indecent Exposure\\n   Well Hi I smile weakly but soon regain my confidence Alison would never have told anyone that story Not a soul couldve possibly heard about that lovely horrible afternoon I grin at her in the darkness of Nells Yeah I remember you You were a real I pause then growl manhandler\\n   She says nothing just looks at me like Im the opposite of civilization or something\\n   Jesus Is Taylor sleeping or just dead Francesca asks while gobbling up whats left of my sorbet Oh my God did anyone read Page Six today I was in it so was Daisy And Taffy too\\n   Alison gets up without looking over at me Im going to find Skip downstairs and dance She walks away\\n   McDermott comes back and gives Alison whos squeezing past him the onceover before taking the seat next to mine\\n   Any luck I ask\\n   No dice he says wiping his nose He lifts my drink to his face and sniffs it then takes a sip and lights one of Daisys cigarettes He looks back at me while lighting it and introduces himself to Francesca before looking back at me Dont look so you knowastounded Bateman Ithappens\\n   I pause staring at him before asking Are you uh like shitting me McDermott\\n   No he says No luck\\n   I pause again then look down at my lap and sigh Look McDermott Ive pulled this act before I know what youre doing\\n   I fucked her He sniffs again pointing at some girl in one of the booths up front McDermotts sweating profusely and reeks of Xeryus\\n   You did Wow Now listen to me I say then notice something out of the corner of my eye Francesca\\n   What She looks up a dribble of sorbet running down her chin\\n   Youre eating my sorbet I point at the dish\\n   She swallows glaring at me Lighten up Bateman What do you want from me you gorgeous stud An AIDS test Oh my god speaking of which that guy over there Krafft Yep No loss\\n   The guy Francesca pointed out is sitting in a booth near the stage where the jazz band plays His hair is slicked back over a very boyish face and hes wearing a suit with pleated trousers and a silk shirt with light gray polka dots by Comme des Garons Homme and sipping a martini and its not difficult to imagine him in someones bedroom tonight lying probably to the girl hes sitting with blonde big tits wearing a metalstudded dress by Giorgio di SantAngelo\\n   Should we tell her someone asks\\n   Oh no Daisy says Dont She looks like a real bitch\\n   Listen to me McDermott I lean in toward him Youhavedrugs I can see it in your eyes Not to mention that fucking sniffing\\n   NopeNegatif Not tonight honey He wags his head\\n   Applause for the jazz band the whole table claps even Taylor whom Francesca has inadvertently woken up and I turn away from McDermott heavily pissed and bring my hands together like everyone else Caron and Libby walk upto the table and Libby says Carons got to go to Atlanta tomorrow Vogueshoot We have to leave Someone gets the check and McDermott puts it on his gold AmEx card which conclusively proves that hes high on coke since hes a famous tightwad\\n   Outside its muggy and theres a faint drizzle almost like a mist lightning but no thunder I trail McDermott hoping to confront him almost bumping into someone in a wheelchair who I remember rolling up to the ropes when we first arrived and the guys still sitting there wheels moving up then backing away up then back on the pavement totally ignored by the doormen\\n   McDermott I call What are you doing Give me yourdrugs\\n   He turns facing me and breaks into this weird jig twirling around then just as abruptly he stops and walks over to a black woman and child who are sitting in the doorway of the closed deli next to Nells and predictably shes begging for food a predictable cardboard sign at her feet Its hard to tell if the kid six or seven is black or not even if its really hers since the light outside Nells is too bright really unflattering and tends to make everyones skin look the same yellowish washedout color\\n   What are theydoing Iibby says staring transfixed Dont they know they need to stand closer to the ropes\\n   Libbycomeon Caron says pulling her toward two taxis at the curb\\n   McDermott I ask What in thehellare you doing\\n   McDermotts eyes are glazed over and hes waving a dollar bill in front of the womans face and she starts sobbing pathetically trying to grab at it but of course typically he doesnt give it to her Instead he ignites the bill with matches from Canal Bar and relights the halfsmoked cigar clenched between his straight white teeth probably caps the jerk\\n   How gentrifying of you McDermott I tell him\\n   Daisy is leaning against a white Mercedes parked next to the curb Another Mercedes this one a limo black is doubleparked next to the white one Theres more lightning An ambulance screams down Fourteenth Street McDermott walks by Daisy and kisses her hand before hopping in the second cab\\n   Im left standing in front of the crying black woman Daisy staring\\n   Jesus I mutter then Here I hand the black woman a book of matches from Lutce before realizing the mistake then find a book of matches from Tavern on the Green and toss them at the kid and pluck the other matchbook from her dirty scabbed fingers\\n   Jesus I mutter again walking over to Daisy\\n   There are no more cabs she says hands on hips Another flash of lightning causes her to jerk her head around whining Wheres the photographers Whos taking thepictures\\n   Taxi I whistle trying to wave down a passing cab\\n   Another bolt of lighting rips across the sky above Zeckendorf Towers and Daisy squeals Whereisthe photographerPatrick Tell them tostop Shes confused her head moving left right behind left right She lowers her sunglasses\\n   Oh my god I mutter my voice building to a shout Itslightning Not a photographerLightning\\n   Oh rightImsupposed to believe you You said Gorbachev was downstairs she says accusingly I dont believe you I think the press is here\\n   Jesus heres a cabHey taxi I whistle at an oncoming cab that has just turned off Eighth Avenue but someone taps my shoulder and when I turn around Bethany a girl I dated at Harvard and who I was subsequently dumped by is standing in front of me wearing a laceembroidered sweater and viscosecrepe trousers by Christian Lacroix an open white umbrella in one hand The cab I was trying to hail whizzes by\\n   Bethany I say stunned\\n   Patrick She smiles\\n   Bethany I say again\\n   How are you Patrick she asks\\n   Um well um Im fine I stutter after an awkward byte of silence And you\\n   Really well thanks she says\\n   You know well were you in there I ask\\n   Yeah I was She nods then Its good to see you\\n   Are you living here I ask gulping In Manhattan\\n   Yes She smiles Im working at Milbank Tweed\\n   Oh well great I look back over at Daisy and Im suddenly angry remembering the lunch in Cambridge at Quarters where Bethany her arm in a sling a faint bruise above her cheek ended it all then just as suddenly Im thinking My hair oh god myhairand I can feel the drizzle ruining it Well I gotta go\\n   Youre at P P right she asks then You look great Spotting another cab approaching I back away Yeah well you know\\n   Lets have lunch she calls out\\n   What could be more fun I say unsure The cab has noticed Daisy and stopped\\n   Ill call you she says\\n   Whatever I say\\n   Some black guy has opened the cab door for Daisy and she steps in daintily and the black guy holds it open for me too while I get in waving nodding to Bethany A tip mister the black guy asks from you and the pretty lady\\n   Yeah I growl trying to check my hair in the cabdrivers rearview mirror Heres a tip get arealjob you dumb fucking nigger Then I slam the door myself and tell the cabdriver to take us to the Upper West Side\\n   Didnt you think it was interesting in that movie tonight how they were spies but they werent spies Daisy asks\\n   And you can drop her off in Harlem I tell the driver\\n   Im in my bathroom shirtless in front of the Orobwener mirror debating whether to take a shower and wash my hair since it looks shitty due to the rain Tentatively I smooth some mousse into it then run a comb over the mousse Daisy sits in the Louis Montoni brass and chrome chair by the futon spooning Macadamia Brittle HagenDazs ice cream into her mouth She is wearing only a lace bra and a garter belt from Bloomingdales\\n   You know she calls out my exboyfriend Fiddler at the party earlier tonight he couldnt understand what I was doing there with a yuppie\\n   Im not really listening but while staring at my hair I manage Oh Really\\n   He said She laughs He said you gave him bad vibes\\n   I sigh then make a muscle Thats too bad\\n   She shrugs and offhandedly admits He used to do a lot of cocaine He used to beat me up\\n   I suddenly start paying attention until she says But he never touched my face\\n   I walk into the bedroom and start undressing\\n   You think Im dumb dont you she asks staring at me her legs tan and aerobicized slung over one of the chairs arms\\n   What I slip my shoes off then bend down to pick them up\\n   You think Im dumb she says You think all models are dumb\\n   No I say trying to contain my laughter I really dont\\n   You do she insists I can tell\\n   I think you are   I stand there my voice trailing off\\n   Yes Shes grinning waiting\\n   I think you are totally brilliant and incredibly brilliant I say in monotone\\n   Thats nice She smiles serenely licking the spoon You have well a tender quality about you\\n   Thanks I take my pants off and fold them neatly hanging them along with the shirt and tie over a black steel Philippe Stark clothes hanger You know the other day I caught my maid stealing a piece of bran toast from my wastebasket in the kitchen\\n   Daisy takes this in then asks Why\\n   I pause staring at her flat welldefined stomach Her torso is completely tan and muscular So is mine Because she said she was hungry\\n   Daisy sighs and licks the spoon thoughtfully\\n   You think my hair looks okay Im still standing there in just my Calvin Klein jockey shorts hardon bulging and a fiftydollar pair of Armani socks\\n   Yeah She shrugs Sure\\n   I sit on the edge of the futon and peel off the socks\\n   I beat up a girl today who was asking people on the street for money I pause then measure each of the following words carefully She was young and seemed frightened and had a sign that explained she was lost in New York and had a child though I didnt see it And she needed money for food or something For a bus ticket to Iowa Iowa I think it was Iowa and I stop for a moment balling the socks up then unballing them\\n   Daisy stares at me blankly for a minute before asking And then\\n   I pause distracted and then stand up Before walking into the bathroom I mutter And then I beat the living shit out of her I open the medicine cabinet for a condom and as I reenter the bedroom say She had misspelleddisabledI mean thats not the reason I did what I did but you know I shrug She was too ugly to rape\\n   Daisy stands up placing the spoon next to the HagenDazs carton on the Gilbert Rhodedesigned nightstand\\n   I point No Put it in the carton\\n   Oh sorry she says\\n   She admires a Palazzetti vase while I slip on the condom I get on top of her and we have sex and lying beneath me she is only a shape even with all the halogen lamps burning Later we are lying on opposite sides of the bed I touch her shoulder\\n   I think you should go home I say\\n   She opens her eyes scratches her neck\\n   I think I might hurt you I tell her I dont think I can control myself\\n   She looks over at me and shrugs Okay Sure then she starts to get dressed I dont want to get too involved anyway she says\\n   I think something bad is going to happen I tell her\\n   She pulls her panties on then checks her hair in the Nabolwev mirror and nods I understand\\n   After shes dressed and minutes of pure hard silence have passed I say not unhopefully You dont want to get hurt do you\\n   She buttons up the top of her dress and sighs without looking over at me Thats why Im leaving\\n   I say I think Im losing it\\n   Paul Owen\\n   I screened calls all morning long in my apartment taking none of them glaring tiredly at a cordless phone while sipping cup after cup of decaf herbal tea Afterwards I went to the gym where I worked out for two hours then I had lunch at the Health Bar and could barely eat half of an endivewithcarrotdressing salad I ordered I stopped at Barneys on my way back from an abandoned loft building I had rented a unit in somewhere around Hells Kitchen I had a facial I played squash with Brewster Whipple at the Yale Club and from there made reservations for eight oclock under the name Marcus Halberstam at Texarkana where Im going to meet Paul Owen for dinner I choose Texarkana because I know that a lot of people I have dealings with are not going to be eating there tonight Plus Im in the mood for their chiliwrapped pork and one or two Dixie beers Its June and Im wearing a twobutton linen suit a cotton shirt a silk tie and leather wingtips all by Armani Outside Texarkana a cheerful black bum motions for me explaining that hes Bob Hopes younger brother No Hope He holds out a Styrofoam coffee cup I think this is funny so I give him a quarter Im twenty minutes late From an open window on Tenth Street I can hear the last strains of A Day in the Life by the Beetles\\n   The bar inTexarkana is empty and in the dining area only four or five tables have people at them Owen is at a booth in the back complaining bitterly to the waiter grilling him demanding to know the exact reasons why they are out of the crawfish gumbo tonight The waiter a notbadlooking faggot is at a loss and helplessly lisps an excuse Owen is in no mood for pleasantries but then neither am I As I sit down the waiter apologizes once more and then takes my drink order JBstraight I stress Anda Dixie beer He smiles while writing this down the bastard even bats his eyelashes  and when Im about to warn him not to attempt small taut with me Owen barks out his drink order Double Absolut martini and the fairy splits\\n   This is really a beehive of uh activity Halberstam Owen says gesturing toward the nearempty room This place is hotveryhot\\n   Listen the mud soup and the charcoal arugula areoutrageous here I tell him\\n   Yeah well he grumbles staring into his martini glass Youre late\\n   Hey Im a child of divorce Give me a break I say shrugging thinking Oh Halberstam youarean asshole And then after Ive studied the menu Hmmm I see theyve omitted the pork loin with lime JellO\\n   Owen is wearing a doublebreasted silk and linen suit a cotton shirt and a silk tie all by Joseph Abboud and his tan is impeccable But hes out of it tonight surprisingly untalkative and his dourness drizzles over my jovial expectant mood dampening it considerably and I have suddenly resorted to making comments such as Is that Ivana Trump over there then laughing  Jeez Patrick I meanMarcus what are youthinking Why would Ivana be at Texarkana But this doesnt make dinner any less monotonous It doesnt help lessen the fact that Paul Owen is exactly my age twentyseven or make this whole thing any less disconcerting to me\\n   What Ive mistaken at first for pomposity on Owens part is actually just drunkenness When I press for information about the Fisher account he offers useless statistical data that I already knew about how Rothschild was originally handling the account how Owen came to acquire it And though I had Jean gather this information for my filesmonths ago I keep nodding pretending that this primitive info is revelatory and saying things like This is enlightening while at the same time telling him Im utterly insane and I like to dissect girls Every time I attempt to steer the conversation back to the mysterious Fisher account he infuriatingly changes the topic back to either tanning salons or brands of cigars or certain health clubs or the best places to jog in Manhattan and he keeps guffawing which I find totally upsetting Im drinking Southern beer for the first part of the meal pre entre post appetizer  then switch to Diet Pepsi midway through since I need to stay slightly sober Im about to tell Owen that Cecelia Marcus Halberstams girlfriend has two vaginas and that we plan to wed next spring in East Hampton but he interrupts\\n   Im feeling er slightly mellow he admits drunkenly squeezing a lime onto the table completely missing his beer mug \\n   Uhhuh I dip a stick of jicama sparingly into a rhubarb mustard sauce pretending to ignore him\\n   Hes so drunk by the time dinner is over that I  make him pay the check which comes to two hundred and fifty dollars a make him admit what a dumb sonof abitch he really is and  get him back to my place where he makes himselfanotherdrink he actually opens a bottle of Acacia I thought I had hidden with a Mulazoni sterling silver wine opener that Peter Radloff bought me after we completed the Heatherberg deal In my bathroom I take out the ax Id stashed in the shower pop two fivemilligram Valium washing them down with a tumblerful of Plax and then I move into the foyer where I put on a cheap raincoat I picked up at Brooks Brothers on Wednesday and move toward Owen who is bent over near the stereo system in the living room looking through my CD collection  all the lights in the apartment on the venetian blinds closed He straightens up and walks slowly backward sipping from his wineglass taking in the apartment until he seats himself in a white aluminum folding chair I bought at the Conrans Memorial Day sale weeks ago and finally he notices the newspapers  copies ofUSA TodayandW andThe New York Times spread out beneath him covering the floor to protect the polished whitestained oak from his blood I move toward him with the ax in one hand and with my other I button up the raincoat\\n   Hey Halberstam he asks managing to slur both words\\n   Yes Owen I say drawing near\\n   Why are there um copies of the Style section all over the place he asks tiredly Do you have a dog A chow or something\\n   No Owen I move slowly around the chair until Im facing him standing directly in his line of vision and hes so drunk he cant even focus in on the ax he doesnt even notice once Ive raised it high above my head Or when I change my mind and lower it to my waist almost holding it as if its a baseball bat and Im about to swing at an oncoming ball which happens to be Owens head\\n   Owen pauses then says Anyway I used to hate Iggy Pop but now that hes so commercial I like him a lot better than\\n   The ax hits him midsentence straight in the face its thick blade chopping sideways into his open mouth shutting him up Pauls eyes look up at me then involuntarily roll back into his head then back at me and suddenly his hands are trying to grab at the handle but the shock of the blow has sapped his strength Theres no blood at first no sound either except for the newspapers under Pauls kicking feet rustling tearing Blood starts to slowly pour out of the sides of his mouth shortly after the first chop and when I pull the ax out almost yanking Owen out of the chair by his head  and strike him again in the face splitting it open his arms flailing at nothing blood sprays out in twin brownish geysers staining my raincoat This is accompanied by a horrible momentary hissing noise actually coming from the wounds in Pauls skull places where bone and flesh no longer connect and this is followed by a rude farting noise caused by a section of his brain which due to pressure forces itself out pink and glistening through the wounds in his face He falls to the floor in agony his face just gray and bloody except for one of his eyes which is blinking uncontrollably his mouth is a twisted redpink jumble of teeth and meat and jawbone his tongue hangs out of an open gash on the side of his cheek connected only by what looks like a thick purple string I scream at him only once Fucking stupid bastard Fucking bastard I stand there waiting staring up at the crack above the Onica that the superintendent hasnt fixed yet It takes Paul five minutes to finally die Another thirty to stop bleeding\\n   I take a cab to Owens apartment on the Upper East Side and on the ride across Central Park in the dead of this stifling June night in the back of the taxi it hits me that Im still wearing the bloody raincoat At his apartment I let myself in with the keys I took from the corpses pocket and once inside I douse the coat with lighter fluid and burn it in the fireplace The living room is very spare minimalist The walls are white pigmented concrete except for one wall which is covered with a trendy largescale scientific drawing and the wall facing Fifth Avenue has a long strip of fauxcowhide paneling stretched across it A black leather couch sits beneath it\\n   I switch on the widescreen thirtyoneinch Panasonic toLate Night with David Letterman then move over to the answering machine to change Owens message While erasing the current one Owen giving all the numbers he can be reached at including the Seaportfor gods sake while VivaldisFour Seasonsplays tastefully in the background I wonder aloud where I should send Paul and after a few minutes of intense debating decide London Ill send the bastard to England I cackle while turning the volume down on the TV and then I leave the new message My voice sounds similar to Owens and to someone hearing it over the phone probably identical Tonight Letterman has on Stupid Pet Tricks A German shepherd with a Mets cap on peels and eats an orange This is replayed twice in slow motion\\n   Into a handconstructed bridle leather suitcase with a khakicolored canvas cover extraheavy cap corners gold straps and locks by Ralph Lauren I pack a wool sixbutton doublebreasted peaklapel chalkstriped suit and one wool flannel navy suit both from Brooks Brothers along with a Mitsubishi rechargeable electric shaver a silverplated shoehorn from Barneys a TagHeuer sports watch a black leather Prada currency holder a Sharp HandyCopier a Sharp Dialmaster his passport in its own black leather passport case and a Panasonic portable hair dryer I also steal for myself a Toshiba portable compact disc player with one of the discs from the original cast recording ofLes Misrablesstill in it The bathroom is done completely in white except for the Dalmatianspot wallpaper covering one wall I throw any toiletry articles I mightve missed into a plastic Hefty bag\\n   Back at my apartment his body is already in rigor mortis and after wrapping it up in four cheap terrycloth towels I also bought at the Conrans Memorial Day sale I place Owen headfirst and fully dressed into a Canalino goosedown sleeping bag which I zip up then drag easily into the elevator then through the lobby past the night doorman down the block where briefly I run into Arthur Crystal and Kitty Martin whove just had dinner at Caf Luxembourg Luckily Kitty Martin is supposed to be dating Craig McDermott who is in Houston for the night so they dont linger even though Crystal  the rude bastard  asks me what the general rules of wearing a white dinner jacket are After answering him curtly I hail a taxi effortlessly manage to swing the sleeping bag into the backseat hop in and give the driver the address in Hells Kitchen Once there I carry the body up four flights of stairs until were at the unit I own in the abandoned building and I place Owens body into an oversize porcelain tub strip off his Abboud suit and after wetting the corpse down pour two bags of lime over it\\n   Later around two in bed Im unable to sleep Evelyn catches me on call waiting while Im listening to messages on TWAT and watching a tape on the VCR of this morningsPatty Winters Show which is about Deformed People\\n   Patrick Evelyn asks\\n   I pause then in a dull monotone calmly announce You have reached Patrick Batemans number He is unable to come to the phone right now So please leave a message after the tone I pause then add Have a nice day I pause again praying to god that she bought it before emitting a pitiful Beep\\n   Oh stop it Patrick she says irritably I know its you What in gods name do you think youre doing\\n   I hold the phone out in front of me then drop it on the floor and bang it against the nightstand I keep pressing some of the numbers down hoping that when I lift the receiver up to my ear Ill be greeted by a dial tone Hello Hello I say Is anyone there Yes\\n   Oh for gods sake stop it Juststopit Evelyn wails\\n   Hi Evelyn I say cheerily my face twisted into a grimace\\n   Where have youbeentonight she asks I thought we were supposed to have dinner I thought we

Hamptons\\n   Ill do that I say Maybe Ill do that\\n   Paul Smith\\n   Im standing in Paul Smith talking to Nancy and Charles Hamilton and their twoyearold daughter Glenn Charles is wearing a fourbutton doublebreasted linen suit by Redaelli a cotton broadcloth shirt by Ascot Chang a patterned silk tie by Eugenio Venanzi and loafers by Brooks Brothers Nancy is wearing a silk blouse with motherofpearl sequins and a silk chiffon skirt by Valentino and silver earrings by Reena Pachochi Im wearing a sixbutton doublebreasted chalkstriped wool suit and a patterned silk tie both by Louis Boston and a cotton oxford cloth shirt by Luciano Barbera Glenn is wearing silk Armani overalls and a tiny Mets cap As the salesgirl rings up Charless purchases Im playing with the baby while Nancy holds her offering Glenn my platinum American Express card and she grabs at it excitedly and Im shaking my head talking in a highpitched baby voice squeezing her chin waving the card in front of her face cooing Yes Im a total psychopathic murderer oh yes I am I like to kill people oh yes I do honey little sweetie pie yes I do After the office today I played squash with Ricky Hendricks then had drinks with Stephen Jenkins at Fluties and Im supposed to meet Bonnie Abbott for dinner at Pooncakes the new Bishop Sullivan restaurant in Gramercy Park at eight oclock The Patty Winters Showthis morning was about Concentration Camp Survivors I take out a Sony Watchman Pocket TV the FD that has a inch blackandwhite miniscreen and weighs only thirteen ounces and hold it out to Glenn Nancy asks Hows the shad roe at Rafaelis Right now outside this store its not dark yet but it is getting there\\n   Its terrific I murmur staring happily at Glenn\\n   Charles signs the slip and while placing his gold American Express card back into his wallet he turns to me and recognizes someone over my shoulder\\n   Hey Luis Charles says smiling\\n   I turn around\\n   Hi Charles Hi Nancy Luis Carruthers kisses Nancys cheek then shakes the babys hand Oh hiya Glenn My my you look so big\\n   Luis you know Robert Chanc Charles starts\\n   Pat Bateman I say putting the Watchman back in my pocket Forget it Weve met\\n   Oh Im sorry Thats right Pat Bateman Charles says Luis is wearing a woolcrepe suit a cotton broadcloth shirt and a silk tie all by Ralph Lauren Like me like Charles he wears his hair slicked back and hes wearing Oliver Peoples redwoodframed glasses Mine at least are nonprescription\\n   Well well I say shaking his hand Luiss grip is overly firm yet horribly sensuous at the same time Excuse me I have to purchase a tie I wave byebye to baby Glenn once more and move off to inspect the neckwear in the adjoining room wiping my hand against a twohundreddollar bath towel that hangs on a marble rack\\n   Soon enough Luis wanders over and leans against the tie drawer pretending to examine the ties like Im doing\\n   What are you doing here he whispers\\n   Buying a tie for my brother Its his birthday soon Excuse me I move down the rack away from him\\n   He must feel very lucky to have a brother like you he says sliding up next to me grinning sincerely\\n   Maybe but I find him completely repellent I say You might like him though\\n   Patrick why wont you look at me Luis asks sounding anguished Lookat me\\n   Pleaseplease leave me alone Luis I say my eyes closed both fists clenched in anger\\n   Come on lets have a drink at Sofis and talk about this he suggests starting to plead\\n   Talk aboutwhat I ask incredulously opening my eyes\\n   Well about us He shrugs\\n   Did youfollow me in here I ask\\n   Intowhere\\n   Here Paul Smith Why\\n   Me Followyou Oh come on He tries to laugh scoffing at my remark Jesus\\n   Luis I say forcing myself to make eye contact Please leave me alone Go away\\n   Patrick he says I love you very much I hope you realize this\\n   I moan moving over to the shoes smiling wanly at a salesperson\\n   Luis follows Patrick what are we doing here\\n   Well Im trying to buy a tie for my brother and I pick up a loafer then sigh  and youre trying to give me head figure it out Jesus Im getting out of here\\n   I move back over to the tie rack grab one without choosing and take it up to the register Luis follows Ignoring him I hand the salesgirl the platinum AmEx card and tell her Theres a bum outside the door I point out the window at the crying homeless man with the bag of newspapers standing on a bench next to the stores entrance You should call the police or something She nods thanks and runs my card through the computer Luis just stands there shyly staring at the ground I sign the receipt take the bag and inform the salesgirl pointing at Luis Hes not with me\\n   Outside I try to wave down a cab on Fifth Avenue Luis hurries out of the store after me\\n   Patrick weve gotto talk he calls out over the roar of traffic He runs up to me grabbing my coat sleeve I whirl around my switchblade already open and I jab it threateningly warning Luis to stay back People move out of our way continue walking\\n   Hey whoa Patrick he says holding his hands up backing off Patrick\\n   I hiss at him still holding out the knife until a cab I flag down skids to a stop Luis tries to get near me his hands still up and I keep the knife aimed at him slicing the air with it while I open the door to the cab and back in still hissing then I close the door and tell the driver to head over to Gramercy Park to Pooncakes\\n   Birthday Brothers\\n   I spend all day thinking about what kind of table my brother Sean and I will be seated at tonight in the Quilted Giraffe Since its his birthday and he happens to be in the city my fathers accountant Charles Conroy and the trustee of his estate Nicholas Leigh both called last week and mutually suggested that it would be in everyones best interest to use this date as an excuse to find out what Seans doing with his life and perhaps to ask a pertinent question or two And tough both of these men know I despise Sean and that the feeling is unambiguously reciprocated it would be a good idea to get him to come to dinner and as a lure as bait in case he refuses by mentioning not lightly that something bad has happened I was on a conference call to Conroy and Leigh last Wednesday afternoon\\n   Something bad Like what I asked trying to concentrate on the numbers sliding across my monitor while simultaneously waving Jean away even though she was holding a sheaf of papers I was supposed to sign That all Michelob breweries in the Northeast are closing That BIMBO has stopped making house calls\\n   No Charles said then quietly mentioned Tell him your mother is worse\\n   I mulled over this tactic then said He might not care\\n   Tell him Nicholas paused then cleared his throat and rather delicately proposed it has to do with her estate\\n   I looked up from the monitor lowering my Wayfarer aviator sunglasses and stared at Jean then lightly fingered the Zagat guide that sat next to the monitor Pastels would be impossible Ditto Dorsia Last time I called Dorsia someone had actually hung up on me even before I asked Well if not next month how about January and though I have vowed to get a reservation at Dorsia one day if not during this calendar year then at least before Im thirty the energy I would spend attempting this feat isnt worth wasting on Sean Besides Dorsias far too chic for him I want to make himendurethis dinner to not be allowed the pleasure of being distracted by hardbodies on their way to Nells somewhere with a mens room attendant so he would have to be painfully subtle about what is now Im sure hischroniccocaine usage I handed the Zagat to Jean and asked her to find the most expensive restaurant in Manhattan She made a nine oclock reservation at the Quilted Giraffe\\n   Things are worse at Sandstone I tell Sean later this afternoon around four oclock Hes staying in our fathers suite at the Carlyle MTV is blasting in the background other voices shout over its din I can hear a shower running\\n   Like what Mom ate her pillow What\\n   I think we should have dinner I say\\n   Dominique cool it he says then places his hand over the phone and mutters something muffled\\n   Hello Sean Whats going on Im asking\\n   Ill call back he says hanging up\\n   I happen to like the tie I bought Sean at Paul Smith last week and Ive decided not to give it to him though the idea of the asshole say hanging himself with it pleases me greatly In factI decide to wear it to the Quilted Giraffe tonight Instead of the tie Im going to bring him a Casio QD QuickDialer combination wristwatch calculator and data bank It dials touchtone phones sonically when held up to a mouthpiece and it stores up to fifty names and numbers I start laughing while putting this useless gift back into its box thinking to myself that Sean doesnt evenhavefifty acquaintances He couldnt even name fifty peopleThe Patty Winters Showthis morning was about Salad Bars\\n   Sean calls at five from the Racquet Club and tells me to meet him at Dorsia tonight He just talked to Brin the owner and reserved a table at nine My mind is a mess I dont know what to think or how to feelThe Patty Winters Showthis morning was about Salad Bars\\n   Later Dorsia ninethirty Sean is half an hour late The matre d refuses to seat me until my brother arrives My worst fear  a reality A prime booth across from the bar sits there empty waiting for Sean to grace it with his presence My rage is controlled barely by a Xanax and an Absolut on the rocks While taking a piss in the mens room I stare into a thin weblike crack above the urinals handle and think to myself that if I were to disappear into that crack say somehow miniaturize and slip into it the odds are good that no one would notice I was gone No one would care In fact some if they noticed my absence might feel an odd indefinable sense of relief This is true the world is better off with some people gone Our lives arenotall interconnected That theory is a crock Some people truly do notneedto be here In fact one of them my brother Sean is sitting in the booth he reserved when I come out of the mens room after Ive phoned the apartment and checked for messages Evelyns suicidal Courtney wants to buy a chow Luis suggests dinner on Thursday Sean is already chainsmoking and Im thinking to myself Damn why didnt I request a table in the nonsmoking section Hes shaking hands with the matre d as I walk over but doesnt even bother to introduce us I sit down and nod Sean nods too having already ordered a bottle of Cristal knowing that Im paying also knowing Im sure thatIknow he doesnt drink champagne\\n   Sean who is now twentythree went to Europe last fall or at least this is what Charles Conroy said Sean told him and though Charlesdidreceive a substantial bill from the Plaza Athne the signature on the receipts didnt match Seans and no one really seemed to know how long Sean was actually in France or even if he had spent real time there Afterwards he bummed around then reenrolled at Camden for about three weeks Now hes in Manhattan before flying to either Palm Beach or New Orleans Predictably tonight hes alternately moody and insistently arrogant He has also Ive just noticed started to pluck his eyebrows He no longer has only one The overwhelming urge I have to mention this to him is quelled only by squeezing my hand into a fist so tightly that I break the skin on the palm of my hand and the biceps of my left arm bulges then rips through the cloth of the linen Armani shirt I have on\\n   So you like this place he asks grinning\\n   My favorite I joke through clenched teeth\\n   Lets order he says not looking at me waving to a hardbody who brings over two menus and a wine list while smiling appreciatively at Sean who in turn ignores her totally I open the menu anddamnitits not prix fixe which means that Sean orders the lobster with caviar and peach ravioli as an appetizer and the blackened lobster with strawberry sauce as an entrethe two mostexpensiveitems on the menu I order the quail sashimi with grilled brioche and the baby softshell crabs with grape jelly A hardbody opens the bottle of Cristal and pours it into crystaltumblers which I guess is supposed to be cool After she leaves Sean notices me staring at him in a vaguely disapproving manner\\n   What he asks\\n   Nothing I say\\n   What is it Patrick He spaces the words out obnoxiously\\n   Lobster to start withAndfor an entre\\n   What do you want me to order The Pringle Potato Chip appetizer\\n   Twolobsters\\n   These matchbooks are slightly larger than the lobster they serve here he says Besides Im not that hungry\\n   Even more of a reason\\n   Ill fax you an apology\\n   Still Sean\\n   Rock n roll\\n   I know I know rock n roll deal with it right I say holding up a hand while sipping the champagne I wonder if its not too late to ask one of the waitresses to bring a piece of cake over here with a candle in it just to embarrass the shit out of him to put the little bastard in his place but instead I put the glass down and ask Listen so oh Jesus I breathe in then force out What did you do today\\n   Played squash with Richard Lindquist He shrugs contemptuously Bought a tuxedo\\n   Nicholas Leigh and Charles Conroy want to know if youre going to the Hamptons this summer\\n   Not if I can help it he says shrugging\\n   A blond girl close enough to physical perfection with big tits and aLes Misrablesplaybill in one hand wearing a long rayon mattejersey evening dress by Michael Kors from Bergdorf Goodman Manolo Blahnik shoes and goldplated chandelier earrings by Ricardo Siberno stops by to say hello to Sean and thoughI would fuck this girl Sean ignores her flirtatious manner and refuses to introduce me During this encounter Sean is completely rude yet the girl leaves smiling raising a gloved hand Well be at Mortimers Later He nods staring at my water glass then waves down a waiter and orders a Scotch straight\\n   Who was that I ask\\n   Some babe who went to Stephens\\n   Where did you meet her\\n   Playing pool at MK He shrugs\\n   Is she a du Pont I ask\\n   Why Do you want her number\\n   No I just wanted to know if shes a du Pont\\n   She might be I dont know He lights another cigarette a Parliament with what looks like an eighteenkarat gold cigarette lighter from Tiffanys She might be a friend of one of the du Ponts\\n   I keep thinking of reasons why Im sitting here right now tonight with Sean at Dorsia but none come to mind Just this infinitely recurring zero floats into view After dinner the food is small but very good Sean touches nothing  I tell him that I have to meet Andrea Rothmere at Nells and if he wants espresso or dessert he should order it now since I have to be downtown by midnight\\n   Why rush he asks Nells isnt that hip anymore\\n   Well I falter quickly regain composure Were just going to meet there Were really going to my mind races lands on something  Chernoble I take another sip of champagne from the tumbler\\n   Big yawnReallybig yawn he says scanning the room\\n   Or Contraclub East I cant remember\\n   Out Stone Age Prehistory He laughs cynically\\n   Tense pause How would you know\\n   Rock n roll He shrugs Deal with it\\n   Well Sean where doyougo\\n   Immediate answer Pettys\\n   Oh yes I murmur having forgotten that it was already open\\n   He whistles something smokes a cigarette\\n   Were going to a party Donald Trumps having I lie\\n   Big fun Very big fun\\n   Donalds a nice guy You should meet him I say Ill introduce you to him\\n   Really Sean asks maybe hopefully maybe not\\n   Yeah sure Ohright\\n   Now by the time I get the check lets see pay it take a cab back to my place it will be almost midnight which doesnt give me enough time to return yesterdays videotapes so if I dont stop by my place I can just go in and rent another videotape though on my membership doesnt it say that you can only take out three at a time So this means last night I took out two Body DoubleandBlond Hot Dead so Icould rent one more but Ive forgotten Im also part of the Gold Circle Membership Plan which means that if Ive spent one thousand dollars at least in the last six months then Im allowed to rent as many videos on any given night as I want but if I still have two out now that might mean I cant take any more out Gold Circle Member or not if the other ones havent been returned but\\n   Damien Youre Damien I think I hear Sean mutter\\n   What did you say I ask looking up I didnt hear you\\n   Nice tan he sighs I said nice tan\\n   Oh I say still confused about the video thing I look down at what my lap Uh thanks\\n   Rockn roll He stamps his cigarette out Fumes rise from the crystal ashtray then die\\n   Sean knowsI know he can probably get us into Pettys which is the new Norman Prager club on Fiftyninth but Im not going to ask him and hes not going to offer I place my platinum American Express card over the check Seans eyes are glued to a hardbody by the bar in a Thierry Mugler wool jersey dress and a Claude Montana scarf sipping from a champagne tumbler When our waitress come by to pick up the check and the card I shake my head no Seans eyes finally fall on it for a second maybe more and I wave the waitress back over and allow her to take it\\n   Lunch with Bethany\\n   Today Im meeting Bethany for lunch at Vanities the new Evan Kiley bistro in Tribeca and though I worked out for nearly two hours this morning and even lifted weights in my office before noon Im still extremely nervous The cause is hard to locate but Ive narrowed it down to one of two reasons Its either that Im afraid of rejection though I cant understand whyshecalledmeshe wants to seemeshe wants to have lunch withmeshe wants to fuckmeagain or on the other hand it could have something to do with this new Italian mousse Im wearing which though it makes my hair look fuller and smells good feels very sticky and uncomfortable and its something I could easily blame my nervousness on So we wouldnt run out of things to talk about over lunch I tried to read a trendy new shortstory collection calledWokthat I bought at Barnes Noble last night and whose young author was recently profiled in the Fast Track section ofNew Yorkmagazine but every story started off with the line When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie and I had to put this slim volume back into my bookshelf and drink a JB on the rocks followed by two Xanax to recover from the effort To make up for this before I fell asleep I wrote Bethany a poem and it took a long time which surprised me since I used to write her poems long dark ones quite often when we were both at Harvard before we broke up God Im thinking to myself as I walk into Vanities only fifteen minutes late I hope she hasnt ended up with Robert Hall that dumb asshole I pass by a mirror hung over the bar as Im led to our table and check out my reflection the mousse looks good The topic onThe Patty Winters Showthis morning was Has Patrick Swayze Become Cynical or Not\\n   I have to stop moving as I near the table following the matre d this is all happening in slow motion She isnt facing me and I can only catch the back of her neck her brown hair pinned up into a bun and when she turns to gaze out the window I see only part of her profile briefly she looksjust like a model Bethanys wearing a silk gazar blouse and a sills satin start with crinoline A Paloma Picasso hunter green suede and wroughtiron handbag sits in front of her on the table next to a bottle of San Pellegrino water She checks her watch The couple next to our table is smoking and after I lean in behind Bethany surprising her kissing her cheek I coolly ask the matre d to reseat us in thenonsmoking section Im suave but loud enough for the nicotine addicts to hear me and hopefully feel a slight twinge of embarrassment about their filthy habit\\n   Well I ask standing there arms crossed tapping my foot impatiently\\n   Im afraid there is no nonsmoking section sir the matre d informs me\\n   I stop tapping my foot and slowly scan the restaurant thebistro wondering how my hair really looks and suddenly I wishI hadswitched mousses because since I last saw my hair seconds ago it feels different as if its shape was somehow altered on the walls from bar to table A pang of nausea that Im unable to stifle washes warmly over me but since Im really dreaming all this Im able to ask So you say theresnononsmoking section Is this correct\\n   Yes sir The matre d younger than myself faggy innocent anactor no doubt adds Im sorry\\n   Well this is very interesting I can accept this I reach into my back pocket for my gazelleskin wallet and press a twenty into the matre ds uncertain fist He looks at the bill confused then murmurs Thank you and walks away as if in a daze\\n   No Thankyou I call out and take my seat across from Bethany nodding courteously to the couple next to us and though I try to ignore her for as long as etiquette allows I cant Bethany looks absolutely stunningjust like a modelEverythings murky Im on edge Feverish romantic notions\\n   Didnt you smoke at Harvard is the first thing she says\\n   Cigars I say Only cigars\\n   Oh she says\\n   But I quit that I lie breathing in hard squeezing my hands together\\n   Thats good She nods\\n   Listen did you have any trouble getting reservations I ask andI am fucking shakingI put my hands on the table like a fool hoping that under her watchful gaze they will stop trembling\\n   You dont need reservations here Patrick she says soothingly reaching out a hand covering one of mine with hers Calm down You look like a wild man\\n   Im clam I mean calm I say breathing in hard trying to smile and then involuntarily unable to stop myself ask Hows my hair\\n   Your hair is fine she says Shhh Its okay\\n   All right I am all right I try to smile again but Im sure it looks just like a grimace\\n   After a short pause she comments Thats a nice suit Henry Stuart\\n   No I say insulted touching its lapel Garrick Anderson\\n   Its very nice she says and then genuinely concerned Are you okay Patrick You just twitched\\n   Listen Im frazzled I just got back from Washington I took the Trump shuttle this morning I tell her unable to make eye contact all in a rush It was delightful The service really fabulous I need a drink\\n   She smiles amused studying me in a shrewd way Was it she asks not totally I sense without smugness\\n   Yes I cant really look at her and it takes immense effort to unfold the napkin lay it across my lap reposition it correctly busy myself with the wineglass praying for a waiter the ensuing silence causing the loudest possible sound So did you watchThe Patty WintersShow this morning\\n   No I was out jogging she says leaning in It was about Michael J Fox right\\n   No I correct her It was about Patrick Swayze\\n   Oh really she asks then Its hard to keeptrack Youre sure\\n   Yes Patrick Swayze Im positive\\n   How was it\\n   Well it was very interesting I tell her breathing in air It was almost like a debate about whether hes gotten cynical or not\\n   Do you think he has she asks still smiling\\n   Well no Im not sure I start nervously Its an interesting question It wasnt explored fully enough I mean after DirtyDancingI wouldnt think so but with Tiger WarsawI dont know I might be crazy but I thought I detectedsomebitterness Im not sure\\n   She stares at me her expression unchanged\\n   Oh I almost forgot I say reaching into my pocket I wrote you a poem I hand her the slip of paper Here I feel sick and broken tortured really on the brink\\n   Oh Patrick She smiles How sweet\\n   Well you know I say looking down shyly\\n   Bethany takes the slip of paper and unfolds it\\n   Read it I urge enthusiastically\\n   She looks it over quizzically puzzled squinting then she turns the page over to see if theres anything on the back Something in her understands its short and she looks back at the words written scrawled in red on the front of the page\\n   Its like haiku you know I say Read it Go on\\n   She clears her throat and hesitantly begins reading slowly stopping often  The poor nigger on the wall Look at him  She pauses and squints again at the paper then hesitantly resumes  Look at the poor nigger Look at the poor nigger on the wall  She stops again faltering looks at me confused then back at the paper\\n   Go on I say looking around for a waiter Finish it\\n   She clears her throat and staring steadily at the paper tries to read the rest of it in a voice below a whisper  Fuck him Fuck the nigger on the wall  She falters again then reads the last sentence sighing  Black man is de debil \\n   The couple at the next table have slowly turned to gaze over at us The man looks aghast the woman has an equally horrified expression on her face I stare her down glaring until she looks back at her fucking salad\\n   Well Patrick Bethany says clearing her throat trying to smile handing the paper back to me\\n   Yes I ask Well\\n   I can see that she stops thinking  that your sense of social injustice is  she clears her throat again and looks down  still intact\\n   I take the paper back from her and slip it in my pocket and smile still trying to keep a straight face holding my body upright so she wont suspect me of cringing Our waiter comes over to the table and I ask him what kinds of beer they serve\\n   Heineken Budweiser Amstel light he recites\\n   Yes I ask staring at Bethany gesturing for him to continue\\n   Thats um all sir he says\\n   No Corona No Kirin No Grolsch No Morretti I ask confused irate\\n   Im sorry sir but no he says cautiously Only Heineken Budweiser Amstel Light\\n   Thats crazy I sigh Ill have a JB on the rocks No an Absolut martini No a JB straight up\\n   And Ill have another San Pellegrino Bethany says\\n   Ill have the same thing I quickly add my leg jerking up then down uncontrollably beneath the table\\n   Okay Would you like to hear the specials he asks\\n   By all means I spit out then calming down smile reassuringly at Bethany\\n   Youre sure He laughs\\n   Please I say unamused studying the menu\\n   For appetizers I have the sundried tomatoes and golden caviar with poblano chilies and I also have a fresh endive soup\\n   Wait a minute wait a minute I say holding up a hand stopping him Hold on a minute\\n   Yes sir the waiter asks confused\\n   Youhave You mean therestauranthas I correct him Youdont have any sundried tomatoes The restaurant doesYoudont have the poblano chilies The restaurant does Just you know clarify\\n   The waiter stunned looks at Bethany who handles the situation deftly by asking him So how is the endive soup served\\n   Er cold the waiter says not fully recovered from my outburst sensing hes dealing with someone very very on edge\\n   He stops again uncertain\\n   Go on I urge Please go on\\n   Its served cold he starts again And for entres we have monkfish with mango slices and red snapper sandwich on brioche with maple syrup and  he checks his pad again  cotton\\n   Mmmm sounds delicious Cotton mmmm I say rubbing my hands together eagerly Bethany\\n   Ill have the ceviche with leeks and sorrel Bethany says And the endive with walnut dressing\\n   Sir the waiter asks tentatively\\n   Ill have  I stop scan the menu quickly Ill have the squid with pine nuts and can I have a slice of goat cheese ofchvre I glance over at Bethany to see if she flinches at my mispronunciation  with that and some oh some salsa on the side\\n   The waiter nods leaves were left alone\\n   Well She smiles then notices the table slightly shaking Whats wrong with your leg\\n   My leg Oh I look down at it then back at her Its the music I like the music a lot The music thats playing\\n   What is it she asks tilting her head trying to catch a refrain of the New Age Muzak coming from the speakers hooked to the ceiling over the bar\\n   Its I think its Belinda Carlisle I guess Im not sure\\n   But she starts then stops Oh forget it\\n   But what\\n   But I dont hear any singing She smiles looks down demurely\\n   I hold my leg still and pretend to listen But its one of her songs I say then lamely add I think its called Heaven Is a Place on Earth You know it\\n   Listen she says have you gone to any concerts lately\\n   No I say wishing she hadnt brought this of all topics up I dont like live music\\n   music she asks intrigued sipping San Pellegrino water\\n   Yeah You know Like a band I explain sensing from her expression that Im saying totally the wrong things Oh I forgot I did see U\\n   How were they she asks I liked the new CD a lot\\n   They were great just totally great Just totally I pause unsure of what to say Bethany raises her eyebrows quizzically wanting to know more Just totally Irish\\n   Ive heard theyre quite good live she says and her own voice has a light musical lilt to it Who else do you like\\n   Oh you know I say completely stuck The Kingsmen Louie Louie That sort of stuff\\n   Gosh Patrick she says looking at every part of my face\\n   What I panic immediately touching my hair Too much mousse You dont like the Kingsmen\\n   No She laughs I just dont remember you being so tan back at school\\n   I had a tan then didnt I I ask I mean I wasnt Casper the Ghost or anything was I I put my elbow on the table and flex my biceps asking her to squeeze the muscle After she touches it reluctantly I resume my questions Was I really not that tan at Harvard I ask mockworriedly but worriedly\\n   No no She laughs You were definitely the George Hamilton of the class of eightyfour\\n   Thanks I say pleased\\n   The waiter brings our drinks two bottles of San Pellegrino water Scene Two\\n   So youre at Mill on the water Taffeta What is it I ask Her body her skin tone seem firm and rosy\\n   Milbank Tweed she says Thats where I am\\n   Well I say squeezing a lime into my glass Thats just wonderful Law school really paid off\\n   And youre at P P she asks\\n   Yes I say\\n   She nods pauses wants to say something debates whether she should then asks all in a matter of seconds But doesnt your family own\\n   I dont want to talk about this I say cutting her off But yes Bethany Yes\\n   And you still work at P P she asks Each syllable is spaced so that it bursts booming sonically into my head\\n   Yes I say looking furtively around the room\\n   But Shes confused Didnt your father\\n   Yes of course I say interrupting Have you had the focaccia at Pooncakes\\n   Patrick\\n   Yes\\n   Whats wrong\\n   I just dont want to talk about I stop About work\\n   Why not\\n   Because I hate it I say Now listen have you tried Pooncakes yet I think Miller underrated it\\n   Patrick she says slowly If youre so uptight about work why dont you just quit You dont have to work\\n   Because I say staring directly at her I want to fit   in\\n   After a long pause she smiles I see Theres another pause\\n   This one I break Just look at it as well a new approach to business I say\\n   How she stalls  sensible She stalls again How um practical\\n   Lunch is alternately a burden a puzzle that needs to be solved an obstacle and then it floats effortlessly into the realm of relief and Im able to give a skillful performance my overriding intelligence tunes in and lets me know that it can sense how much she wants me but I hold back uncommitted Shes also holding back but flirting nonetheless She has made a promise by asking me to lunch and I panic once the squid is served certain that I will never recover unless its fulfilled Other men notice her as they pass by our table Sometimes I coolly bring my voice down to a whisper Im hearing things  noise mysterious sounds inside my head her mouth opens closes swallows liquid smiles takes me in like a magnet covered with lipstick mentions something involving fax machines twice I finally order a JB on the rocks then a cognac She has mintcoconut sorbet I touch hold her hand across the table more than a friend Sun pours into Vanities the restaurant empties out it nears three She orders a glass of chardonnay then another then the check She has relaxed but something happens My heartbeat rises and falls momentarily stabilizes I listen carefully Possibilities once imagined plummet She lowers her eyes and when she looks back at me I lower mine\\n   So she asks Are you seeing anyone\\n   My life is essentially uncomplicated I say thoughtfully caught off guard\\n   What doesthatmean she asks\\n   I take a sip of cognac and smile secretly to myself teasing her dashing her hopes her dreams of being reunited\\n   Are you seeing anyone Patrick she asks Come on tell me\\n   Thinking of Evelyn I murmur to myself Yes\\n   Who I hear her ask\\n   A very large bottle of Desyrel I say in a faraway voice suddenly very sad\\n   What she asks smiling but then she realizes something and shakes her head I shouldnt be drinking\\n   No Im not really I say snapping out of it then not of my own accord I mean does anyone reallyseeanyone Does anyone reallyseeanyone else Didyouever seemeSeeWhat does that mean HaSeeHa I just dont get it Ha I laugh\\n   After taking this in she says nodding That has a certain kind of tangled logic to it I suppose\\n   Another long pause and I fearfully ask the next question Well areyouseeing anyone\\n   She smiles pleased with herself and still looking down admits with incomparable clarity Well yes I have a boyfriend and\\n   Who\\n   What She looks up\\n   Who is he Whats his name\\n   Robert Hall Why\\n   With Salomon Brothers\\n   No hes a chef\\n   With Salomon Brothers\\n   Patrick hes achefAnd coowner of a restaurant\\n   Which one\\n   Does it matter\\n   No really which one I ask then under my breath I want to cross it out of my Zagat guide\\n   Its called Dorsia she says then Patrick are you okay\\n   Yes my brain does explode and my stomach bursts open inwardly a spastic acidic gastric reaction stars and planets whole galaxies made up entirely of little white chef hats race over the film of my vision I choke out another question\\n   Why Robert Hall I ask Why him\\n   Well I dont know she says sounding a little tipsy I guess it has to do with being twentyseven and\\n   Yeah So am I So is half of Manhattan So what Thats no excuse to marry Robert Hall\\n   Marry she asks wideeyed defensive Did I say that\\n   Didnt you say marry\\n   No I didnt but who knows She shrugs We might\\n   Terrific\\n   As I was saying Patrick she glares at me but in a playful way that makes me sick  I thinkyou know that well time is running out That biological clock just wont stop ticking she says and Im thinking My god it took onlytwo glasses of chardonnay to get her to admit this Christ what a lightweight I want to have children\\n   With Robert Hall I ask incredulous You might as well do it with Captain Lou Albano for Christ sakes I just dont get you Bethany\\n   She touches her napkin looking down and then out onto the sidewalk where waiters are setting up tables for dinner I watch them too Why do I sense hostility on your part Patrick she asks softly then sips her wine\\n   Maybe because Im hostile I spit out Maybe because you sense this\\n   Jesus Patrick she says searching my face genuinely upset I thought you and Robert were friends\\n   What I ask Im confused\\n   Werent you and Robert friends\\n   I pause doubtful Were we\\n   Yes Patrick youwere\\n   Robert Hall Robert Hall Robert Hall I mutter to myself trying to remember Scholarship student President of our senior class I think about it a second longer then add Weak chin\\n   No Patrick she says TheotherRobert Hall\\n   Im confusing him with theotherRobert Hall I ask\\n   Yes Patrick she says exasperated\\n   Inwardly cringing I close my eyes and sigh Robert Hall Not the one whose parents own half of like Washington Not the one who was I gulp  captain of the crew team Six feet\\n   Yes she says ThatRobert Hall\\n   But I stop\\n   Yes Butwhat She seems prepared to wait for an answer\\n   But he was afag I blurt out\\n   No he wasnot Patrick she says clearly offended\\n   Im positive he was a fag I start nodding my head\\n   Why are you so positive she asks not amused\\n   Because he used to let frat guys not the ones in my house  like you know gang bang him at parties and tie him up and stuff At least you know thats what Ive heard I say sincerely and then more humiliated than I have ever been in my entire life I confess Listen Bethany he offered me a you know a blow job once In the um civics section of the library\\n   Oh my god she gasps disgusted Wheres the check\\n   Didnt Robert Hall get kicked out for doing his thesis on Babar Or something like Babar I ask Babar the elephant The oh JesusFrenchelephant\\n   What are youtalkingabout\\n   Listen to me I say Didnt he go to business school at Kellogg At Northwestern right\\n   He dropped out she says without looking at me\\n   Listen I touch her hand\\n   She flinches and pulls back\\n   I try to smile Robert Halls not a fag\\n   I can assure you of that she says a tad too smugly How can anyone get indignant over Robert Hall Instead of saying Oh yeah you dumb sorry bitch I say soothingly Im sure you can then Tell me about him I want to know how things stand with the two of you and then smiling furious full of rage I apologize Im sorry\\n   It takes some time but she finally relents and smiles back at me and I ask her once again Tell me more and then under my breath smiling a rictus at her Id like to slice open your beaver The chardonnay has mellowed her so she softens and talks freely\\n   I think about other things while she describes her recent past air water sky time a moment a point somewhere when I wanted to show her everything beautiful in the world I have no patience for revelations for new beginnings for events that take place beyond the realm of my immediate vision A young girl a freshman I met in a bar in Cambridge my junior year at Harvard told me early one fall that Life is full of endless possibilities I tried valiantly not to choke on the beer nuts I was chewing while she gushed this kidney stone of wisdom and I calmly washed them down with the rest of a Heineken smiled and concentrated on the dart game that was going on in the corner Needless to say she did not live to see her sophomore year That winter her body was found floating in the Charles River decapitated her head hung from a tree on the bank her hair knotted around a lowhanging branch three miles away My rages at Harvard were less violent than the ones now and its useless to hope that my disgust will vanish there is just no way\\n   Oh Patrick shes saying Youre still the same I dont know if thats good or bad\\n   Say its good\\n   Why Is it she asks frowning Was it Then\\n   You only knew one facet of my personality I say Student\\n   Lover she asks her voice reminding me of someone human\\n   My eyes fall on her coldly untouched Out on the street music that sounds like salsa blares The waiter finally brings the check\\n   Ill pay for it I sigh\\n   No she says opening her handbag Iinvitedyou\\n   But I have a platinum American Express card I tell her\\n   But so do I she says smiling\\n   I pause then watch her place the card on the tray the check came on Violent convulsions seem close at hand if I do not get up The womens movement Wow I smile unimpressed\\n   Outside she waits on the sidewalk while Im in the mens room throwing up my lunch spitting out the squid undigested and less purple than it was on my plate When I come out of Vanities onto the street putting on my Wayfarers chewing a Cert I murmur something to myself and then I kiss her on the cheek and make up something else Sorry it took so long Had to call my lawyer\\n   Oh She acts concerned the dumb bitch\\n   Just a friend of mine I shrug Bobby Chambers Hes in prison Some friends of his well mainlymeare trying to remount his defense I say with another shrug then changing the subject Listen\\n   Yes she asks smiling\\n   Its late I dont want to go back to the office I say checking my Rolex The sun setting glints off it momentarily blinding her Why dont you come up to my place\\n   What She laughs\\n   Why dont you come up to my place I suggest again\\n   Patrick She laughs suggestively Are you serious\\n   I have a bottle of PouillyFuisschilled huh I say arching my eyebrows\\n   Listen that line mightve worked at Harvard but she laughs then continues  um were older now and   She stops\\n   And what I ask\\n   I shouldnt have had that wine at lunch she says again\\n   We start walking Its a hundred degrees outside impossible to breathe Its not day its not night The sky seems yellow I hand a beggar on the cornea of Duane and Greenwich a dollar just to impress her\\n   Listen come over I say again almost whining Come on over\\n   I can t she says The airconditioning in my office is broken but I cant Id like to but I cant\\n   Aw come on I say grabbing her shoulders giving them a goodnatured squeeze\\n   Patrick I have to be back at the office she groans protesting weakly\\n   But youll besweltering in there I point out\\n   I have no choice\\n   Come on Then trying to entice her I have a s Durgin Gorham fourpiece sterling silver tea and coffee set Id like to show you\\n   I cant She laughs putting on her sunglasses\\n   Bethany I say warning her\\n   Listen she says relenting Ill buy you a Dove Bar Have a Dove Bar instead\\n   Im appalled Do you know how many grams of fat ofsodiumare in the chocolate covering alone I gasp mock horrified\\n   Come on she says You dont need to worry about that\\n   Noyou come on I say walking in front of her for a little while so she wont sense any aggressiveness on my part Listen come by for a drink and then well walk over to Dorsia and Ill meet Robert okay I turn around still walking but backward now Please\\n   Patrick she says Youre begging\\n   I really want to show you that Durgin Gorham tea set I pause Please I pause again It cost me three and a half thousand dollars\\n   She stops walking because I stop looks down and when she looks back up her brow both cheeks are damp with a layer of perspiration a fine sheen Shes hot She sighs smiling to herself She looks at her watch\\n   Well I ask\\n   If I did she starts\\n   Yeees I ask stretching the word out\\n   If I did I have to make a phone call\\n   No negative I say waving down a cab Call from my place\\n   Patrick she protests Theres a phone right over there\\n   Lets go now I say Theres a taxi\\n   In the cab heading toward the Upper West Side she says I shouldnt have had that wine\\n   Are you drunk\\n   No she says fanning herself with a playbill fromLes Misrablessomeone left in the backseat of the cab which isnt airconditioned and even with both windows open she keeps fanning herself Just slightly tipsy\\n   We both laugh for no reason and she leans into me then realizes something and pulls back You have a doorman right she asks suspiciously\\n   Yes I smile turned on by her unawareness of just how close to peril she really is\\n   Inside my apartment She moves into the living room area nodding her head approvingly murmuring Very nice Mr Bateman very nice Meanwhile Im locking the door making sure its bolted shut then I move over to the bar and pour some JB into a glass while she runs her hand over the Wurlitzer jukebox inspecting it Ive started growling to myself and my hands are shaking so badly I decide to forgo any ice and then Im in the living room standing behind her while she looks up at the David Onica thats hung above the fireplace She cocks her head studying it then she starts giggling and looks at me puzzled then back at the Onica still laughing I dont ask whats wrong I could care less Downing the drink in a single gulp I move over to the Anaholian whiteoak armoire where I keep a brandnew nail gun I bought last week at a hardware store near my office in Wall Street After Ive slipped on a pair of black leather gloves I make sure the nail gun is loaded\\n   Patrick Bethany asks still giggling\\n   Yes I say then Darling\\n   Who hung the Onica she asks\\n   You like it I ask\\n   Its fine but She stops then says Im pretty sure its hung upside down\\n   What\\n   Whohung the Onica\\n   I did I say my back still to her\\n   Youve hung the Onicaupside down She laughs\\n   Hmmm Im standing at the armoire squeezing the nail gun getting used to its weight in my gloved fist\\n   I cant believe its upside down she says How long has it been this way\\n   A millennium I whisper turning around nearing her\\n   What she asks still studying the Onica\\n   I said what in the fuck are you doing with Robert Hall I whisper\\n   What did you say As if in slow motion like in a movie she turns around\\n   I wait until shes seen the nail gun and the gloved hands to scream What the fuck are you doing with Robert Hall\\n   Perhaps on instinct perhaps from memory she makes a futile dash for the front door crying out Though the chardonnay has dulled her reflexes the Scotch Ive drunk has sharpened mine and effortlessly Im leaping in front of her blocking her escape knocking her unconscious with four blows to the head from the nail gun I drag her back into the living room laying her across the floor over a white Voilacutro cotton sheet and then I stretch her arms out placing her hands flat on thick wooden boards palms up and nail three fingers on each hand at random to the wood by their tips This causes her to regain consciousness and she starts screaming After Ive sprayed Mace into her eyes mouth into her nostrils I place a camelhair coat from Ralph Lauren over her head which drowns out the screams sort of I keep shooting nails into her hands until theyre both covered nails bunched together twisted over each other in places making it impossible for her to try and sit up I have to remove her shoes which slightly disappoints me but shes kicking at the floor violently leaving black scuff marks on the stained white oak During this period I keep shouting You bitch at her and then my voice drops to a raspy whisper and into her ear I drool the line You fucking cunt\\n   Finally in agony after Ive taken the coat off her face she starts pleading or at least tries to the adrenaline momentarily overpowering the pain Patrick oh god stop it please oh god stop hurting me But typically the pain returns  its too intense not to  and she passes out again and vomits while unconscious and I have to hold her head up so she doesnt choke on it and then I Mace her again The fingers I havent nailed I try to bite off almost succeeding on her left thumb which I manage to chew all the flesh off of leaving the bone exposed and then I Mace her needlessly once more I place the camelhair coat back over her head in case she wakes up screaming then set up the Sony palmsized Handycam so I can film all of what follows Once its placed on its stand and running on automatic with a pair of scissors I start to cut off her dress and when I get up to her chest I occasionally stab at her breasts accidentally not really slicing off one of her nipples through the bra She starts screaming again once Ive ripped her dress off leaving Bethany in only her bra its right cup darkened with blood and her panties which are soaked with urine saving them for later\\n   I lean in above her and shout over her screams Try to scream scream keep screaming Ive opened all the windows and the door to my terrace and when I stand over her the mouth opens and not even screams come out anymore just horrible guttural animallike noises sometimes interrupted by retching sounds Scream honey I urge keep screaming I lean down even closer brushing her hair back No one cares No one will help you She tries to cry out again but shes losing consciousness and shes capable of only a weak moan I take advantage of her helpless state and removing my gloves force her mouth open and with the scissors cut out her tongue which I pull easily from her mouth and hold in the palm of my hand warm and still bleeding seeming so much smaller than in her mouth and I throw it against the wall where it sticks for a moment leaving a stain before falling to the floor with a tiny wet slap Blood gushes out of her mouth and I have to hold her head up so she wont choke Then I fuck her in the mouth and after Ive ejaculated and pulled out I Mace her some more\\n   Later when she briefly regains consciousness I put on a porkpie hat I was given by one of my girlfriends freshman year at Harvard\\n   Rememberthis I shout towering over her And look atthis I scream triumphantly holding up a cigar Istillsmoke cigars Ha See A cigar I light it with steady bloodstained fingers and her face pale to the point of blueness keeps contracting twitching with pain her eyes dull with horror close then open halfway her life reduced to nightmare\\n   And another thing I yell pacing Its not Carrick Anderson either The suit is byArmani GiorgioArmani I pause spitefully and leaning into her sneer And you thought it wasHenry StuartJesus I slap her hard across the face and hiss the words Dumb bitch spraying her face with spit but its covered with so much Mace that she probably cant even feel it so I Mace her again and then I try to fuck her in the mouth once more but I cant come so I stop\\n   Thursday\\n   Later the next night in fact three of us Craig McDermott Courtney and myself are in a cab heading toward Nells and talking about Evian water Courtney in an Armani mink has just admitted giggling that she uses Evian for ice cubes which sparks a conversation about the differences in bottled water and at Courtneys request we each try to list as many brands as we can\\n   Courtney starts counting each name off on one of her fingers Well theres Sparcal Perrier San Pellegrino Poland Spring Calistoga She stops stuck and looks over at McDermott for help\\n   He sighs then lists Canadian Spring Canadian Calm Montclair which is also from Canada Vittel from France Crodo which is Italian He stops and rubs his chin thoughtfully thinking of one more then announces it as if surprised Elan And though it seems hes on the verge of naming another one Craig lapses into an unilluminating silence\\n   Elan Courtney asks\\n   Its from Switzerland he says\\n   Oh she says then turns to me Its your turn Patrick\\n   Staring out the window of the cab lost in thought the silence Im causing filling me with a nameless dread numbly by rote I list the following You forgot Alpenwasser Down Under Schat which is from Lebanon Qubol and Cold Springs\\n   I said that one already Courtney cuts in accusingly\\n   No I say You said PolandSpring\\n   Is that right Courtney murmurs then tugging at McDermotts overcoat Is he right Craig\\n   Probably McDermott shrugs I guess\\n   You must also remember that one should always buy mineral water inglass bottles You shouldnt buy it in plastic ones I say ominously then wait for one of them to ask me why\\n   Why Courtneys voice is tinged with actual interest\\n   Because it oxidizes I explain You want it to be crisp with no aftertaste\\n   After a long confused Courtneylike pause McDermott admits staring out the window Hes right\\n   I really dont understand the differences in water Courtney murmurs Shes sitting between McDermott and myself in the back of the cab and under the mink has on a wool twill suit by Givenchy tights by Calvin Klein and shoes by Warren Susan Allen Edmonds Earlier in this same cab when I touched the mink suggestively with no intent other than to check its quality and she could sense this Courtney quietly asked me if I had a breath mint I said nothing\\n   What do you mean McDermott inquires solemnly\\n   Well she says I mean whatsreally the difference between something like spring water and natural water for instance or I mean is there one\\n   CourtneyNatural water is any water from an underground source Craig sighs still staring out the window Mineral content hasnt been changed although the water may have been disinfected or filtered McDermott is wearing a wool tuxedo with notched lapels by Cianni Versace and he reeks of Xeryus\\n   I momentarily break out of my conscious inertia to explain further And in spring water minerals may have been added or removed and its usually filtered not processed I pause Seventyfive percent of all bottled water in America is actually spring water I pause again then ask the cab Did anyone know that\\n   A long soulless pause follows and then Courtney asks another question this one only half finished The differences between distilled and purified water is\\n   Im not really listening to any of this conversation not even to myself because Im thinking of ways to get rid of Bethanys body or at least debating whether or not I should keep it in my apartment another day or so If I decide to get rid of it tonight I can easily stuff whats left of her into a Hefty garbage bag and leave it in the stairwell or I can exert the extra effort and drag it into the street leaving it with the rest of the trash on the curb I could even take it to the apartment in Hells Kitchen and pour lime over it smoke a cigar and watch it dissolve while listening to my Walkman but I want to keep the mens bodies separate from the womens and besides I also want to watchBloodhungrythe videotape I rented this afternoon its ad line reads Some clowns make you laugh but Bobo will make you die and then hell eat your body  and a midnight trip to Hells Kitchen even without a stop at Bellvues for a small bite to eat wouldnt give me enough time Bethanys bones and most of her intestines and flesh will probably get dumped into the incinerator down the hall from my apartment\\n   Courtney McDermott and I have just left a Morgan Stanley party that took place near the Seaport at the tip of Manhattan in a new club called Goldcard which seemed like a vast city of its own and where I ran into Walter Rhodes a total Canadian whom I havent seen since Exeter and who also like McDermott reeked of Xeryus and I actually told him Listen Im trying to stay away from people Im avoiding even speaking to them and then I asked to be excused Only slightly stunned Walter said Uh sure I um understand Im wearing a sixbutton doublebreasted woolcrepe tuxedo with pleated trousers and a silk grosgrain bow tie all by Valentino Luis Carruthers is in Atlanta for the week I did a line of coke with Herbert Gittes at Goldcard and before McDermott hailed this cab to head for Nells I took a Halcion to get rid of the edge from the cocaine but it hasnt sunk in yet Courtney seems attracted to McDermott and since her Chembank card wasnt functioning tonight at least not at the automated teller we stopped at the reason being she uses it too often to cut lines of coke with though she would never admit this cocaine residue has at various times fucked up my card also and McDermottswas working she bypassedminein favor ofhis which means knowing Courtney that she wants tofuckMcDermott But it doesnt really matter Even though Im more handsome than Craig we both look pretty much the same Talking animals were the topic of this morningsPatty Winters Show An octopus was floating in a makeshift aquarium with a microphone attached to one of its tentacles and it kept asking or so its trainer who is positive that mollusks have vocal cords assured us  for cheese I watched vaguely transfixed until I started to sob A beggar dressed as a Hawaiian frets over a garbage can on the darkened corner of Eighth and Tenth\\n   With distilled or purified water McDermott is saying most of the minerals have been removed The water has been boiled and the steam condensed into purified water\\n   Wheras distilled water has a flat taste and its usually not for drinking I find myself yawning\\n   And mineral water Courtney asks\\n   Its not defined by the McDermott and I start simultaneously\\n   Go ahead I say yawning again causing Courtney to yawn also\\n   No you go ahead he says apathetically\\n   Its not defined by the FDA I tell her It has no chemicals or salts or sugars or caffeine\\n   And sparkling water gets its fizz from carbon dioxide right she asks\\n   Yes Both McDermott and I nod staring straight ahead\\n   I knew that she says hesitantly and by the tone of her voice I can sense without looking over that she probably smiles when she says this\\n   But only buynaturallysparkling water I caution Becausethatmeans the carbon dioxide content is in the water at its source\\n   Club soda and seltzer for example are artificially carbonated McDermott explains\\n   White Rock seltzer is an exception I mention nonplussed by McDermotts ridiculous incessant oneupmanship Ramlsa sparkling mineral water is also very good\\n   The cab is about to turn onto Fourteenth street but maybe four or five limousines are trying to make the same right so we miss the light I curse the driver but an old Motown song from the sixties maybe its the Supremes plays muted up front the sound blocked by the fiberglass partition I try to open it but its locked and wont slide across Courtney asks What kind should you drink after exercising\\n   Well I sigh Whatever it is it should be really cold\\n   Because she asks\\n   Because its absorbed faster than if it was at room temperature Absently I check my Rolex It should probably be water Evian But not in plastic\\n   My trainer says Gatorades okay McDermott counters\\n   But dont you hunk water is the best fluid replacer since it enters the bloodstream faster thanandother liquid I cant help but add Buddy\\n   I check my watch again If I have one JB on the rocks at Nells I can make it home in time to watch all ofBloodhungryby two Again its silent in the cab which moves steadily toward the crowd outside the club the limousines dropping off passengers then moving on each of us concentrating on that and also on the sky above the city which is heavy looming with dark clouds The limousines keep blaring their horns at each other solving nothing My throat because of the coke I did with Gittes feels parched and I swallow trying to wet it Posters for a sale at Crabtree Evelyn line the boarded windows of abandoned tenement buildings on the other side of this street Spell mogul Bateman How do you spell mogul Mogul Mogul Mogul Ice ghosts aliens\\n   I dont like Evian McDermott says somewhat sadly Its too sweet He looks so miserable when he admits this that it moves me to agree\\n   Glancing over at him in the darkness of the cab realizing hes probably going to end up in bed with Courtney tonight I feel an instantaneous moment of pity for him\\n   Yes McDermott I say slowly Evianistoo sweet\\n   Earlier there was so much of Bethanys blood pooled on the floor that I could make out my reflection in it while I reached for one of my cordless phones and I watched myself make a haircut appointment at Gios Courtney breaks my trance by admitting I was afraid to try Pellegrino for the first time She looks over at me nervously expecting me to what agree  then at McDermott who offers her a wan tight smile But once I did it was fine\\n   How courageous I murmur yawning again the cab inching its way toward Nells then raising my voice Listen does anyone know of a device you can hook up to your phone to simulate that callwaiting sound\\n   Back at my place I stand over Bethanys body sipping a drink contemplatively studying its condition Both eyelids are open halfway and her lower teeth look as if theyre jutting out since her lips have been torn actually bitten  off Earlier in the day I had sawed off her left arm which is what finally killed her and right now I pick it up holding it by the bone that protrudes from where her hand used to be I have no idea where it is now the freezer the closet clenching it in my fist like apipe flesh and muscle still clinging to it though a lot of it has been hacked or gnawed off and I bring it down on her head It takes very few blows five or six at most to smash her jaw open completely and only two more for her face to cave in on itself\\n   Whitney Houston\\n   Whitney Houston burst onto the music scene in  with her selftitled LP which had four number one hit singles on it including The Greatest Love of All You Give Good Love and Saving All My Love for You plus it won a Grammy Award for best pop vocal performance by a female and two American Music Awards one for best rhythm and blues single and another for best rhythm and blues video She was also cited as best new artist of the year byBillboardand byRolling Stonemagazine With all this hype one might expect the album to be an anticlimactic lackluster affair but the surprise is thatWhitney HoustonArista is one of the warmest most complex and altogether satisfying rhythm and blues records of the decade and Whitney herself has a voice that defies belief From the elegant beautiful photo of her on the cover of the album in a gown by Giovanne De Maura and its fairly sexy counterpart on the back in a bathing suit by Norma Kaman one knows that this isnt going to be a blandly professional affair the recordis smooth but intense and Whitneys voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile though shes mainly a jazzsinger that its hard to take in the album on a first listening But you wont want to Youll want to savor it over many\\n   It opens with You Give Good Love and Thinking About You both produced and arranged by Kashif and they emanate warm lush jazz arrangements but with a contemporary synthesized beat and though theyre both really good songs the album doesnt get kicking until Someone for Me which was produced by Jermaine Jackson where Whitney sings longingly against a jazzdisco background and the difference between her longing and the sprightliness of the song is very moving The ballad Saving All My Love for You is the sexiest most romantic song on the record It also has a killer saxophone solo by Tom Scott and one can hear the influences of sixties girlgroup pop in it it was cowritten by Gerry Goffin but the sixties girl groups were never this emotional or sexy or as well produced as this song is Nobody Loves Me Like You Do is a glorious duet with Jermaine Jackson who also produced it and just one example of how sophisticated lyrically this album is The last thing it suffers from is a paucity of decent lyrics which is what usually happens when a singer doesnt write her own material and has to have her producer choose it But Whitney and company have picked well here\\n   The dance single How Will I Know my vote for best dance song of the s is a joyous ode to a girls nervousness about whether another guy is interested in her Its got a great keyboard riff and its the only track on the album produced by wunderkind producer Narada Michael Walden My own personal favorite ballad aside from The Greatest Love of All her crowning achievement is All at Once which is about how a young woman realizes all at once her lover is fading away from her and its accompanied by a gorgeous string arrangement Even though nothing on the album sounds like filler the only track that might come close is Take Good Care of My Heart another duet with Jermaine Jackson The problem is that it strays from the albums jazz roots and seems too in fluenced by s dance music\\n   But Whitneys talent is restored with the overwhelming The Greatest Love of All one of the best most powerful songs ever written about selfpreservation and dignity From the first line Michael Masser and Linda Creed are credited as the writers to the last its a stateoftheart ballad about believing in yourself Its a powerful statement and one that Whitney sings with a grandeur that approaches the sublime Its universal message crosses all boundaries and instills one with the hope that its not too late for us to better ourselves to act kinder Since its impossible in the world we live in to empathize with others we can always empathize with ourselves Its an important message crucial really and its beautifully stated on this album\\n   Her second effortWhitneyArista  had four number one singles I Wanna Dance with Somebody So Emotional Didnt We Almost Have It All and Where Do Broken Hearts Go and was mostly produced by Narada Michael Walden and though its not as serious an effort asWhitney Houstonits hardly a victim of Sophomore Slump It starts off with the bouncy danceable I Wanna Dance with Somebody Who Loves Me which is in the same vein as the last albums irrepressible How Will I Know This is followed by the sensuous Just the Lonely Talking Again and it reflects the serious jazz influence that permeated the first album and one can also sense a newfound artistic maturity in Whitneys voice she did all the vocal arrangements on this album  and this is all very evident on Love Will Save the Day which is the most ambitious song Whitneys yet performed It was produced by Jellybean Benitez and it pulsates with an uptempo intensity and like most of the songs on this album it reflects a grownups awareness of the world we all live in She sings and we believe it This is quite a change from the softer littlegirllost image that was so appealing on the first album\\n   She projects an even more adult image on the Michael Masserproduced Didnt We Almost Have It All a song about meeting up with a longlost lover and letting him know your feelings about the past affair and its Whitney at her most poetic And as on most of the ballads theres a gorgeous string arrangement So Emotional is in the same vein as How Will I Know and I Wanna Dance with Somebody but its even more rockinfluenced and like all the songs onWhitneyplayed by a terrific backup studio band with Narada on drum machine Wolter Afanasieff on the synthesizer and synth bass Corrado Rustici on synth guitar and someone listed as Bongo Bob on percussion programming and drum sampling Where You Are is the only song on the album produced by Kashif and it bears his indelible imprint of professionalism it has a smooth gleaming sound and sheen to it with a funky sax solo by Vincent Henry It sounded like a hit single to me but then all the songs on the album do and I wondered why it wasnt released as one\\n   Love Is a Contact Sport is the albums real surprise a bigsounding bold sexy number that in terms of production is the albums centerpiece and it has great lyrics along with a good beat Its one of my favorites On Youre Still My Man you can hear how clearly Whitneys voice is like an instrument  a flawless warm machine that almost overpowers the sentiment of her music but the lyrics and the melodies are too distinctive too strong to let any singer even one of Whitneys caliber overshadow them For the Love of You shows off Naradas brilliant drum programming capabilities and its jazzy modern feel harks back not only to purveyors of modern jazz like Michael Jackson and Sade but also to other artists like Miles Davis Paul Butterfield and Bobby McFerrin\\n   Where Do Broken Hearts Go is the albums most powerful emotional statement of innocence lost and trying to regain the safety of childhood Her voice is as lovely and controlled as it ever has been and it leads up to I Know Him So Well the most moving moment on the record because its first and foremost a duet with her mother Cissy Its a ballad about who  a lover shared a longlost father  with a combination of longing regret determination and beauty that ends the album on a graceful perfect note We can expect new things from Whitney she made a stunning gift to the  Olympics with the ballad One Moment in Time but even if we didnt she would remain the most exciting and original black jazz voice of her generation\\n   Dinner with Secretary\\n   Monday night at eight oclock Im in my office attempting yesterdaysNew York TimesSunday crossword puzzle listening to rap music on the stereo trying to fathom its popularity since a little blonde hardbody I met at Au Bar two nights ago told me that rap is all she listens to and though later I beat the living shit out of her at someones apartment in the Dakota she was almost decapitated hardly a strange experience for me earlier this morning her taste in music haunted my memory and I had to stop at Tower Records on the Upper West Side and buy ninety dollars worth of rap CDs but as expected Im at a loss niggerish voices uttering ugly words likedigit pudding chunkJean sits at her desk which is piled high with reams of documents that I want her to go over Today has not been bad I worked out for two hours before the office the new Robison Hirsch restaurant called Finna opened in Chelsea Evelyn left two messages on my answering machine and another with Jean letting me know that shell be in Boston for most of the week and best of allThe Patty Winters Showthis morning was in two parts The first was an exclusive interview with Donald Trump the second was a report on women whove been tortured Im supposed to have dinner with Madison Grey and David Campion at Caf Luxembourg but at eightfifteen I find out that Luis Carruthers is going to be dining with us so I call up Campion the dumb bastard and cancel then spend minutes debating about what I should do with the rest of the evening Looking out my window I realize that within moments the sky above this city will be completely dark\\n   Jean peers into my office knocking gently on the halfopen door I pretend not to acknowledge her presence though Im not sure why since Im kind of lonely She moves up to the desk Im still staring at the crossword puzzle with my Wayfarers on stunned but for no real reason\\n   She places a file on top of the desk before asking Doin the crossword dropping thegin doing a pathetic gesture of intimacy an irritating stab at forced friendliness I gag inwardly then nod without looking up at her\\n   Need help she asks moving cautiously around the desk to where I sit and she leans over my shoulder to offer assistance Ive already filled in every space with either the wordmeatorboneand she emits only a slight gasp when noticing this and when she sees the pile of No  pencils Ive snapped in half lying on my desk she dutifully picks them up and walks out of the room\\n   Jean I call\\n   Yes Patrick She reenters the office trying to downplay her eagerness\\n   Would you like to accompany me to dinner I ask still staring at the crossword gingerly erasing themin one of the manymeats Ive filled the puzzle with That is if youre not doing anything\\n   Oh no she answers too quickly and then I think realizing this quickness says I have no plans\\n   Well isnt this a coincidence I ask looking up lowering my Wayfarers\\n   She laughs lightly but theres a real urgency in it something uncomfortable and this does little in the way of making me feel less sick\\n   I guess she shrugs\\n   I also have tickets to a a Mills Vanilla concert if youd like to go I tell her casually\\n   Confused she asks Really Who\\n   Milla Vanilla I repeat slowly\\n   Milla Vanilla she asks uncomfortably\\n   Milla Vanilla I say I think thats what their name is\\n   She says Im not sure\\n   About going\\n   No of the name She concentrates then says I think theyre called Milli Vanilli\\n   I pause for a long time before saying Oh\\n   She stands there nods once\\n   It doesnt matter I say I dont have any tickets to it anyway Its months from now\\n   Oh she says nodding again Okay\\n   Listen where should we go I lean back and pull my Zagat from the desks top drawer\\n   She pauses afraid of what to say taking my question as a test she needs to pass and then unsure shes chosen the right answer offers Anywhere you want\\n   No no no I smile leafing through the booklet How about anywhereyouwant\\n   Oh Patrick she sighs I cant make this decision\\n   No come on I urge Anywhere you want\\n   Oh I cant Helplessly she sighs again I dont know\\n   Come on I urge her where do you want to go Anywhere you want Just say it I can get us in anywhere\\n   She thinks about it for a long time and then sensing her time is running out timidly asks trying to impress me What about Dorsia\\n   I stop looking through the Zagat guide and without glancing up smiling tightly stomach dropping I silently ask myself Do I really want to say no Do I really want to say I cant possibly get us in Is that what Im really prepared to do Is that what I really want to do\\n   Soooo I say placing the book down then nervously opening it up again to find the number Dorsia is where Jean wants to go\\n   Oh I dont know she says confused No well go anywhere you want\\n   Dorsia is fine I say casually picking up the phone and with a trembling finger very quickly dial the seven dreaded numbers trying to remain cool Instead of the busy signal Im expecting the phone actually rings at Dorsia and after two rings the same harassed voice Ive grown accustomed to for the past free months answers shouting out Dorsia yes the room behind the voice a deafening hum\\n   Yes can you take two tonight oh lets say in around twenty minutes I ask checking my Rolex offering Jean a wink She seems impressed\\n   We are totally booked the matre d shouts out smugly\\n   Oh really I say trying to look pleased on the verge of vomiting Thats great\\n   I said we are totally booked he shouts\\n   Two at nine I say Perfect\\n   There are no tables available tonight the matre d unflappable drones The waiting list is also totally booked He hangs up\\n   See you then I hang up too and with a smile that tries its best to express pleasure at her choice I find myself fighting for breath every muscle tensed sharply Jean is wearing a wool jersey and flannel dress by Calvin Klein an alligator belt with a silver buckle by Barry Kieselstein Cord silver earrings and clear stockings also by Calvin Klein She stands there in front of the desk confused\\n   Yes I ask walking over to the coatrack Youre dressed okay\\n   She pauses You didnt give them a name she says softly\\n   I think about this while putting on my Armani jacket and while reknotting my Armani silk tie and without stammering I tell her They know me\\n   While the matre d seats a couple who Im pretty sure are Kate Spencer and Jason Lauder Jean and I move up to his podium where the reservation book lies open names absurdly legible and leaning over it casually I spot the only name for two at nine without a line drawn through it which happens to be  oh Jesus Schrawtz I sigh and tapping my foot my mind racing I try to concoct some kind of feasible plan Suddenly I turn to Jean and say Why dont you go to the womens room\\n   Shes looking around the restaurant taking it in Chaos People are waiting ten deep at the bar The matre d seats the couple at a table in the middle of the room Sylvester Stallone and a bimbo sit in the front booth that Sean and I sat in just weeks before much to my sickened amazement and his bodyguards are piled into the booth next to that and the owner of Pettys Norman Prager lounges in the third Jean turns her head to me and shouts What over the din\\n   Dont you want to use the ladies room I ask The matre d nears us picking his way through the packed restaurant unsmiling\\n   Why I mean do I she asks totally confused\\n   Just   go I hiss desperately squeezing her arm\\n   But I dont need to go Patrick she protests\\n   Oh Christ I mutter Now its too late anyway\\n   The matre d walks up to the podium and inspects the book takes a phone call hangs up in a matter of seconds then looks us over not exactly displeased The matre d is at least fifty and has a ponytail I clear my throat twice to get his full attention make some kind of lame eye contact\\n   Yes he asks as if harassed\\n   I give him a dignified expression before sighing inside Reservations at nine I gulp For two\\n   Yeees he asks suspiciously drawing the word out Name he says then turns to a passing waiter eighteen and model handsome whod asked Wheres da ice Hes glaring and shouting Not now Okay How many times do you need to be told The waiter shrugs humbly and then the matre d points off toward the bar Daice is over dere He turns back to us and I am genuinely frightened\\n   Name he commands\\n   And Im thinking Of all the fucking names why this one Um Schrawtz oh god  Mr and Mrs Schrawtz My face Im sure is ashen and I say the name mechanically but the matre d is too busy to not buy it and I dont even bother to face Jean who Im sure is totally bewildered by my behavior as were led to the Schrawtzes table which Im sure probably sucks though Im relieved anyway\\n   Menus already lie on the table but Im so nervous the words and even the prices look like hieroglyphics and Im completely at a loss A waiter takes our drink order the same one who couldnt locate the ice  and I find myself saying things without listening to Jean like Protecting the ozone layer is a really cool idea and telling knockknock jokes I smile fixing it on my face in another country and it takes no time at all  minutes really thewaiter doesnt even get a chance to tell us about the specials  for me to notice the tall handsome couple by the podium conferring with the matre d and after sighing very deeply lightheaded stammering I mention to Jean Something bad is happening\\n   She looks up from the menu and puts down the iceless drink\\n   shes been sipping Why Whats wrong\\n   The matre d is glaring over at us at me from across the room as he leads the couple toward our table If the couple had been short dumpy excessively Jewish I couldve kept this table even without the aid of a fifty but this couple looks like theyve just strolled out of a Ralph Lauren ad and though Jean and I do too and so does the rest of the whole goddamn restaurant the man is wearing a tuxedo and the girl  a totally fuckable babe  is covered with jewels This is reality and as my loathsome brother Sean would say I have to deal with it The matre d now stands at the table hands clasped behind his balk unamused and after a long pause asks Mr and MrsSchrawtz\\n   Yes I play it cool\\n   He just stares This is accompanied by an abnormal silence His ponytail gray and oily hangs like some kind of malignancy below his collar\\n   You know I finally say somewhat suavely I happen to know the chef\\n   He continues staring So no doubt does the couple behind him\\n   After another long pause for no real reason I ask Is he in Aspen\\n   This is getting nowhere I sigh and turn to Jean who looks completely mystified Lets go okay She nods dumbly Humiliated I take Jeans hand and we get up she slower than I  brushing past the matre d and the couple and make our way back through the crowded restaurant and then were outside and Im utterly devastated and murmuring robotically to myself I should have known better I should have known better I should but Jean skips down thestreet laughing pulling me along and when I finally notice her unexpected mirth between giggles she lets out That wassofunny and then squeezing my clenched fist she lets me know Your sense of humor is sospontaneous Shaken walking stiffly by her side ignoring her I ask myself Where to now and in seconds come up with an answer  Arcadia toward which I find myself guiding us\\n   After someone who I think is Hamilton Conway mistakes me for someone named Ted Owen and asks if I can get him into Pettys tonight I tell him Ill see what I can do then turn whats left of my attention to Jean who sits across from me in the nearempty dining room of Arcadia  after he leaves only five of the restaurants tables have people at them Ive ordered a JB on the rocks Jeans sipping a glass of white wine and talking about how what she really wants to do is get into merchant banking and Im thinking Dare to dream Someone else Frederick Dibble stops by and congratulates me on the Larson account and then has the nerve to say Talk to you later Saul But Im in a daze millions of miles away and Jean doesnt notice shes talking about a new novel shes been reading by some young author its cover Ive seen slathered with neon its subject lofty suffering Accidentally I think shes talking about something else and I find myself saying without really looking over at her You need a tough skin to survive in this city She flushes seems embarrassed and takes another sip ofthe wine which is a nice sauvignon blanc\\n   You seem distant she says\\n   What I ask blinking\\n   I said you seem distant she says\\n   No I sigh Im still my same kooky self\\n   Thats good She smiles am I dreaming this  relieved\\n   So listen I say trying to focus in on her what do you really want to do with your life Then remembering how she was droning on about a career in merchant banking I add Just briefly you know summarize Then I add And dont tell me you enjoy working with children okay\\n   Well Id like to travel she says And maybe go back to school but I really dont know She pauses thoughtfully and announces sincerely Im at a point in my life where there seems to be a lot of possibilities but Im so I dont know unsure\\n   I think its also important for people to realize their limitations Then out of the blue I ask Do you have a boyfriend\\n   She smiles shyly blushes and then says No Not really\\n   Interesting I murmur Ive opened my menu and Im studying tonights prix fixe dinner\\n   Areyou seeing anyone she ventures timidly I mean seriously\\n   I decide on the pilot fish with tulips and cinnamon evading the question by sighing I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special and before shes allowed to respond I ask her what shes going to order\\n   I think the mahimahi she says and then squinting at the menu with ginger\\n   Im having the pilot fish I say Im developing a taste for them For pilot fish I say nodding\\n   Later after a mediocre dinner a bottle of expensive California cabernet sauvignon and a crime brle that we share I order a glass of fiftydollar port and Jean sips a decaffeinated espresso and when she asks where the restaurant got its name I tell her and I dont make anything ridiculous up  though Im tempted just to see if shed believe it anyway Sitting across from Jean right now in the darkness of Arcadia its very easy to believe that she would swallow any kind of misinformation I push her way  the crush she has on me rendering her powerless  and I find this lack of defense oddly unerotic I could even explain my proapartheid stance and have her find reasons whyshe too should share them and invest large sums of money in racist corporations tha\\n   Arcadia was an ancient region in Peloponnesus Greece which was founded in  BsC and it was completely surrounded by mountains Its chief city was Megalopolis which was also the center of political activity and the capital of the Arcadian confederacy I take a sip of the port which is thick strong expensive It was destroyed during the Greek war of independence I pause again Pan was worshiped originally in Arcadia Do you know who Pan was\\n   Never taking her eyes off me she nods\\n   His revels were very similar to those of Bacchus I tell her He frolicked with nymphs at night but he also liked to frighten travelers during the day Hence the wordpanic Blah blah blah Im amused that Ive retained this knowledge and I look up from the port Ive been staring thoughtfully into and smile at her Shes silent for a long time confused unsure of how to respond but eventually she looks deeply into my eyes and says haltingly leaning across the table Thats so interesting which is all that comes out of her mouth is all she has to say\\n   Eleven thirtyfour We stand on the sidewalk in front of Jeans apartment on the Upper East Side Her doorman eyes us warily and fills me with a nameless dread his gaze piercing me from the lobby A curtain of stars miles of them are scattered glowing across the sky and their multitude humbles me which I have a hard time tolerating She shrugs and nods after I say something about forms of anxiety Its as if her mind is having a hard time communicating with her mouth as if she is searching for a rational analysis of who I am which is of course an impossibility there is no key\\n   Dinner was wonderful she says Thank you very much\\n   Actually the food was mediocre but youre welcome I shrug\\n   Do you want to come up for a drink she asks too casually and even though Im critical of her approach it doesnt necessarily mean that I dont want to go up but something stops me something quells the bloodlust the doorman the way the lobby is lit her lipstick Plus Im beginning to think that pornography is so much less complicated than actual sex and because of this lack of complication so much more pleasurable\\n   Do you have any peyote I ask\\n   She pauses confused What\\n   Just a joke I say then Listen I want to watchDavid Lettermanso   I pause unsure as to why Im lingering I should go\\n   You can watch it She stops then suggests at my place\\n   I pause before asking Do you have cable\\n   Yes She nods I have cable\\n   Stuck I pause again then pretend to mull it over No its okay I like to watch it without cable\\n   She offers a sad perplexed glance What\\n   I have to return some videotapes I explain in a rush\\n   She pauses Now Its she checks her witch  almost midnight\\n   Well yeah I say considerably detached\\n   Well I guess its good night then she says\\n   What kind of books does Jean read Titles race through my mindHow to Make a Man Fall in Love with You How to Keep a Man in Lone with You Forever How to Close a Deal Get Married How to Be Married One Year from Today SupplicantIn my overcoat pocket I finger the ostrich condom case from Luc Benoit I bought last week but er no\\n   After awkwardly shaking hands she asks still holding mine Really You dont have cable\\n   And though it has been in no way a romantic evening she embraces me and this time emanates a warmth Im not familiar with I am so used to imagining everything happening the way it occurs in movies visualizing things falling somehow into the shape of events on a screen that I almost hear the swelling of an orchestra can almost hallucinate the camera panning low around us fireworks bursting in slow motion overhead the seventymillimeter image of her lips parting and the subsequent murmur of Iwantyou in Dolby sound But my embrace is frozen and I realize at first distantly and they with greater clarity that the havoc raging inside me is gradually subsiding and she is kissing me on the mouth and this jars me back into some kind of reality and I lightly push her away She glances up at me fearfully\\n   Listen Ive got to go I say checking my Rolex I dont want to miss Stupid Pet Tricks\\n   Okay she says composing herself Bye\\n   Night I say\\n   We both head off in our separate directions but suddenly she calls out something\\n   I turn around\\n   Dont forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at   she says from the door which the doorman is holding open for her\\n   Thanks I call out waving It slipped my mind completely\\n   She waves back disappearing into the lobby\\n   On my way over to Park Avenue to find a cab I pass an ugly homeless bum a member of the genetic underclass  and when he softly pleads for change for anything I notice the Barnes Noble book bag that sits next to him on the steps of the church hes begging on and I cant help but smirk out loud Oh right like you read and then in the back of the cab on the way across town to my apartment I imagine running around Central Park on a cool spring afternoon with Jean laughing holding hands We buy balloons we let them go\\n   Detective\\n   May slides into June which slides into July which creeps toward August Because of the heat Ive had intense dreams the last four nights about vivisection and Im doing nothing now vegetating in my office with a sickening headache and a Walkman with a soothing Kenny G CD playing in it but the bright midmorning sunlight floods the room piercing my skull causing my hangover to throb and because of this theres no workout this morning Listening to the music I notice the second light on my phone blinking off and on which means that Jean is buzzing me I sigh and carefully remove the Walkman\\n   What is it I ask in monotone\\n   Um Patrick she begins\\n   Yees Jean I ask condescendingly spacing the two words out\\n   Patrick a Mr Donald Kimball is here to see you she says nervously\\n   Who I snap distracted\\n   She emits a small sigh of worry then as if asking lowers her voice DetectiveDonald Kimball\\n   I pause staring out the window into sky then at my monitor then at the headless woman Ive been doodling on the back cover of this weeksSports Illustrated and I run my hand over the glossy finish of the magazine once twice before tearing the cover off and crumpling it up Finally I start Tell him Then mulling it over rethinking my options I stop and begin again Tell him Im at lunch\\n   Jean pauses then whispers Patrick I think he knows youre here During my protracted silence she adds still hushed Its tenthirty\\n   I sigh stalling again and in a contained panic tell Jean Send him in I guess\\n   I stand up walk over to the Jodi mirror that hangs next to the George Stubbs painting and check my hair running an oxhorn comb through it then calmly I pick up one of my cordless phones and preparing myself for a tense scene pretend to be talking with John Akers and I start enunciating clearly into the phone before the detective enters the office\\n   Now John I clear my throat Youve got to wear clothes in proportion to your physique I begin talking to nobody There are definitelydosanddontsgood buddy of wearing a boldstriped shirt A boldstriped shirt calls for solid colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties\\n   The door to the office opens and I wave in the detective who is surprisingly young maybe my age wearing a linen Armani suit not unlike mine though his is slightly disheveled in a hip way which worries me I offer a reassuring smile\\n   And a shirt with a high yarn count means its more durable than one that doesnt Yes I know But to determine this youve got to examine the materialsweave I point to the Mark Schrager chrome and teak chair on the opposite side of my desk silently urging him to sit\\n   Tightly woven fabric is created not only by using a lot of yarn but by using yarn of highquality fibers both long and thin which yes which are which fabricate a close weave as opposed to short and stubbly fibers like those found in tweed And looselywovenfabrics such as knits are extremely delicate and should be treated with great care Because of the detectives arrival it seems unlikely that this will be a good day and I eye him warily as he takes the seat and crosses his legs in a way that fills me with a nameless dread I realize Ive been quiet too long when he turns around to see if Im off the phone\\n   Right and Yes John right And yes always tip the stylist fifteen percent I pause No the owner of the salon shouldnt be tipped   I shrug at the detective hopelessly rolling my eyes He nods smiles understandingly and recrosses his legs Nice socks Jesus The girl who washes the hair It depends Id say adollar or two I laugh Depends on what she looks like I laugh harder And yeah what else she washes I pause again then say Listen John Ive got to go T Boone Pickens just walked in I pause grinning like an idiot then laugh Just joking Anotherpause No dont tip the owner of the salon I laugh once more then finally Okay John right got it I hang up the phone push its antenna down and then uselessly stressing my normality say Sorry about that\\n   NoImsorry he says genuinely apologetic I shouldve made an appointment Gesturing toward the cordless phone Im placing back in its recharging cradle he asks Was that uh anything important\\n   Oh that I ask moving toward my desk sinking into my chair Just mulling over business problems Examining opportunities Exchanging rumors Spreading gossip We both laugh The ice breaks\\n   Hi he says sitting up holding out his hand Im Donald Kimball\\n   Hi Pat Bateman I take it squeezing it firmly Nice to meet you\\n   Im sorry he says to barge in on you like this but I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasnt in and well youre here so He smiles shrugs I know how busy you guys can get He averts his eyes from the three copies ofSports Illustratedthat lie open atop my desk covering it along with the Walkman I notice them too then close all three issues and slip them into the desks top drawer along with the stillrunning Walkman\\n   So I start trying to come off as friendly and conversational as possible Whats the topic of discussion\\n   Well he starts Ive been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen\\n   I nod thoughtfully before asking Youre not with the FBI or anything are you\\n   No no he says Nothing like that Im just a private investigator\\n   Ah I see Yes I nod again still not relieved Pauls disappearance Yes\\n   So its nothingthatofficial he confides I just have some basic questions About Paul Owen About yourself\\n   Coffee I ask suddenly\\n   As if unsure he says No Im okay\\n   Perrier San Pellegrino I offer\\n   No Im okay he says again opening a small black notebook hes taken out of his pocket along with a gold Cross pen\\n   I buzz Jean\\n   Yes Patrick\\n   Jean can you bring Mr I stop look up\\n   He looks up too Kimball\\n   Mr Kimball a bottle of San Pelle\\n   Oh no Im okay he protests\\n   Its no problem I tell him\\n   I get the feeling hes trying not to stare at me strangely He turns back to his notebook and writes something down then crosses something out Jean walks in almost immediately and she places the bottle of San Pellegrino and a Steuben etchedglass tumbler on my desk in front of Kimball She gives me a fretful worried glance which I scowl at Kimball looks up smiles and nods at Jean who I notice is not wearing a bra today Innocently I watch her leave then return my gaze to Kimball clasping my hands together sitting up Well whats the topic of discussion I say again\\n   The disappearance of Paul Owen he says reminding me\\n   Oh right Well I havent heard anything about the disappearance or anything I pause then try to laugh Not on Page Six at least\\n   Kimball smiles politely I think his family wants this kept quiet\\n   Understandable I nod at the untouched glass and bottle and then look up at him Lime\\n   No really he says Im okay\\n   You sure I ask I can always get you a lime\\n   He pauses briefly then says Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files okay\\n   Shoot I say\\n   How old are you he asks\\n   Twentyseven I say Ill be twentyeight in October\\n   Where did you go to school He scribbles something in his book\\n   Harvard I tell him Then Harvard Business School\\n   Your address he asks looking only at his book\\n   Fiftyfive West Eightyfirst Street I say The American Gardens Building\\n   Nice He looks up impressed Very nice\\n   Thanks I smile flattered\\n   Doesnt Tom Cruise live there he asks\\n   Yup I squeeze the bridge of my nose Suddenly I have to close my eyes tightly\\n   I hear him speak Pardon me but are you okay\\n   Opening my eyes both of them tearing I say Why do you ask\\n   You seemnervous\\n   I reach into a drawer in my desk and bring out a bottle of aspirin\\n   Nuprin I offer\\n   Kimball looks at the bottle strangely and then back at me before shaking his head Uh no thanks Hes taken out a pack of Marlboros and absently lays it next to the San Pellegrino bottle while studying something in the book\\n   Bad habit I point out\\n   He looks up and noticing my disapproval smiles sheepishly I know Im sorry\\n   I stare at the box\\n   Do you would you rather I not smoke he asks tentative\\n   I continue to stare at the cigarette packet debating No I guess its okay\\n   You sure he asks\\n   No problem I buzz Jean\\n   Yes Patrick\\n   Bring us an ashtray for Mr Kimball please I say\\n   In a matter of seconds she does\\n   What can you tell me about Paul Owen he finally asks after Jean leaves having placed a Fortunoff crystal ashtray on the desk next to the untouched San Pellegrino\\n   Well I cough swallowing two Nuprin dry I didnt know him that well\\n   How well didyou know him he asks\\n   Im at a loss I tell him somewhat truthfully He was part of that whole Yale thing you know\\n   Yalething he asks confused\\n   I pause having no idea what Im talking about Yeah   Yale thing\\n   What do you mean Yale thing Now hes intrigued\\n   I pause again whatdo I mean Well I think for one that he was probably a closet homosexual I have no idea doubt it considering his taste in babes Who did a lot of cocaine I pause then add a bit shakily ThatYale thing Im sure I say this bizarrely but theres no other way to put it\\n   Its very quiet in the office right now The room suddenly seems cramped and sweltering and even though the airconditioning is on full blast the air seems fake recycled\\n   So Kimball looks at his book helplessly Theres nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen\\n   Well I sigh He led what I suppose was an orderly life I guess Really stumped I offer He ate a balanced diet\\n   Im sensing frustration on Kimballs part and he asks What kind of man was he Besides he falters tries to smile  the information youve just given\\n   How could I describe Paul Owen to this guy Boasting arrogant cheerful dickhead who constantly weaseled his way out of checks at Nells That Im heir to the unfortunate information that his penis had a name and that name wasMichael No Calmer Bateman I think that Im smiling\\n   I hope Im not being crossexamined here I manage to say\\n   Do you feel that way he asks The question sounds sinister but isnt\\n   No I say carefully Not really\\n   Maddeningly he writes something else down then asks without looking up chewing on the tip of the pen Where did Paul hang out\\n   Hang out I ask\\n   Yeah he says You know hang out\\n   Let me think I say tapping my fingers across my desk The Newport Harrys Fluties Indochine Nells Cornell Club The New York Yacht Club The regular places\\n   Kimball looks confused He had a yacht\\n   Stuck I casually say No He just hung out there\\n   And where did he go to school he asks\\n   I pause Dont you know this\\n   I just wanted to know if you know  he says without looking up\\n   Er Yale I say slowly Right\\n   Right\\n   And then to business school at Columbia I add Ithink\\n   Before all that he asks\\n   If I remember correctly Saint Pauls I mean\\n   No its okay Thats not really pertinent he apologizes I just have no other questions I guess I dont have a lot to go on\\n   Listen I just I start softly tactfully I just want to help\\n   I understand he says\\n   Another long pause He marks something down but it doesnt seem important\\n   Anything else you can tell me about Owen he asks sounding almost timid\\n   I think about it then feebly announce We were both seven in \\n   Kimball smiles So was I\\n   Pretending to be interested in the case I ask Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints\\n   He cuts me off tiredly Well theres a message on his answering machine saying he went to London\\n   Well I ask then hopefully maybe he did huh\\n   His girlfriend doesnt think so Kimball says tonelessly\\n   Without even beginning to understand I imagine what a speck Paul Owen was in the overall enormity of things\\n   But I stop Has anyone seen him in London\\n   Kimball looks at his book flips over a page and then looking back at me says Actually yes\\n   Hmmm I say\\n   Well Ive had a hard time getting an accurate verification he admits A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there but I checked it out and what happened is he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul so\\n   Oh I say\\n   Do you remember where you were on the night of Pauls appearance He checks his book Which was on the twentyfourth of June\\n   Gosh I guess I think about it I was probably returning videotapes I open my desk drawer take out my datebook and looking through December announce I had a date with a girl named Veronica Im completely lying totally making this up\\n   Wait he says confused looking at his book Thats   not what Ive got\\n   My thigh muscles tense What\\n   Thats not the information Ive received he says\\n   Well Im suddenly confused and scared the Nuprin bitter in mystomach I Wait What informationhaveyou received\\n   Lets see He flips through his pad finds something That you were with\\n   Wait I laugh Icouldbe wrong My spine feels damp\\n   Well He stops When was the last time you were with Paul Owen he asks\\n   We had oh my god Bateman think up something  gone to a new musical that just opened called OhAfrica Brave Africa I gulp It was a laugh riot and thats about it I think we had dinner at Orsos no Petaluma No Orsos\\n   I stop The last time I physicallysaw him was at an automated teller I cant remember which just one that was near um Nells\\n   But the night he disappeared Kimball asks\\n   Im not really sure I say\\n   I think maybe youve got your dates mixed up he says glancing at his book\\n   But how I ask Where do you place Paul that night\\n   According to his datebook and this was verified by his secretary he had dinner with Marcus Halberstam he says\\n   And I ask\\n   Ive questioned him\\n   Marcus\\n   Yes And he denies it Kimball says Though at first he couldnt be sure\\n   But Marcus denied it\\n   Yes\\n   Well does Marcus have an alibi I have a heightened receptivity to his answers now\\n   Yes\\n   Pause\\n   Hedoes I ask Youre sure\\n   I checked it out  he says with an odd smile Its clean\\n   Pause\\n   Now where wereyou He laughs\\n   I laugh too though Im not sure why Where was Marcus Im almost giggling\\n   Kimball keeps smiling as he looks me over He wasnt with Paul Owen he says enigmatically\\n   So who was he with Im laughing still but Im also very dizzy\\n   Kimball opens his book and for the first time gives me a slightly hostile look He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott Frederick Dibble Harry Newman George Butner and Kimball pauses then looks up  you\\n   In this office right now I am thinking about how long it would take a corpse to disintegrate right in this office In this office these are the things I fantasize about while dreaming Eating ribs at Red Hot and Blue in Washington DC If I should switch shampoos What really is the best dry beer Is Bill Robinson an overrated designer Whats wrong with IBM Ultimate luxury Is the term playing hardball an adverb The fragile peace of Assisi Electric light The epitome of luxury Of ultimate luxury The bastards wearing the same damn Armani linen suit Ive got on How easy it would be to scare the living wits out of this fucking guy Kimball is utterly unaware of how truly vacant I am There is no evidence of animate life in this office yet still he takes notes By the time you finish reading this sentence a Boeing jetliner will take off or land somewhere in the world I would like a Pilsner Urquell\\n   Oh right I say Of course We had wanted Paul Owen to come I say nodding my head as if just realizing something But he said he had plans Then lamely I guess I had dinner with Victoria the following night\\n   Listen like I said I was just hired by Meredith He sighs closing his book\\n   Tentatively I ask Did you know that Meredith Powell is dating Brock Thompson\\n   He shrugs sighs I dont know about that All I know is that Paul Owen owes her supposedly a lot of money\\n   Oh I say nodding Really\\n   Personally he says confiding I think the guy went a little nutso Split town for a while Maybe hedid go to London Sightseeing Drinking Whatever Anyway Im pretty sure hell turn up sooner or later\\n   I nod slowly hoping to look suitably bewildered\\n   Was he involved at all do you think in say occultism or Satan worship Kimball asks seriously\\n   Er what\\n   I know it sounds like a lame question but an New Jersey last month I dont know if youve heard about this but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with well various body parts\\n   Yikes I exclaim\\n   And I mean He smiles sheepishly again Have you heard anything about this\\n   Did the guy deny doing it I ask tingling\\n   Right Kimball nods\\n   That was an interesting case I manage to say\\n   Even though the guy says hes innocent he still thinks hes Inca the bird god or something Kimball says scrunching his features up\\n   We both laugh out loud about this\\n   No I finally say Paul wasnt into that He followedabalanced diet and\\n   Yeah I know and was into that whole Yale thing Kimball finishes tiredly\\n   There is a long pause that I think might be the longest one so far\\n   Have you consulted a psychic I ask\\n   No He shakes his head in a way that suggests hes considered it Oh whocares\\n   Had his apartment been burglarized I ask\\n   No it actually hadnt he says Toiletries were missing A suit was gone So was some luggage Thats it\\n   Do you suspect foul play\\n   Cant say he says But like I told you I wouldnt be surprised if hes just hiding out someplace\\n   I mean no ones dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything right I ask\\n   No not yet As I said were not sure But He stops looks dejected Basically no one has seen or heard anything\\n   Thats so typical isnt it I ask\\n   Its just strange he agrees staring out the window lost One day someones walking around going to workalive and then Kimball stops fails to complete the sentence\\n   Nothing I sigh nodding\\n   People just disappear he says\\n   The earth just opens up and swallows people I say somewhat sadly checking my Rolex\\n   Eerie Kimball yawns stretching Really eerie\\n   Ominous I nod my agreement\\n   Its just he sighs exasperated  futile\\n   I pause unsure of what to say and come up with Futility is hard to deal with\\n   I am thinking about nothing Its silent in the office To break it I point out a book on top of the desk next to the San Pellegrino bottleThe Art of the Deal by Donald Trump\\n   Have you read it I ask Kimball\\n   No he sighs but politely asks Is it any good\\n   Its very good I say nodding\\n   Listen He sighs again Ive taken up enough of your time He pockets the Marlboros\\n   I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at The Four Seasons in twenty minutes anyway I lie standing up I have to go too\\n   Isnt The Four Seasons a little far uptown He looks concerned also getting up I mean arent you going to be late\\n   Uh no I stall Theres one down here\\n   Oh really he asks I didnt know that\\n   Yes I say leading him to the door Its very good\\n   Listen he says turning to face me If anything occurs to you any information at all\\n   I hold up a hand Absolutely Im one hundred percent with you I say solemnly\\n   Great the ineffectual one says relieved And thanks for your uh time Mr Bateman\\n   Moving him toward the door my legs wobbly astronautlike leading him out of the office though Im empty devoid of feeling I still sense without deluding myself  that Ive accomplished something and then anticlimactically we talk for a few minutes more about razorburn balms and tattersall shirts There was an odd general lack of urgency to the conversation that I found soothing  nothing happened at all  but when he smiles hands me his card leaves the door closing sounds to me like a billion insects screaming pounds of bacon sizzling a vast emptiness And after he leaves the building I have Jean buzz Tom at Security to make sure I call someone recommended by my lawyer to make sure none of my phones are wiretapped and after a Xanax Im able to meet with my nutritionist at an expensive upscale healthfood restaurant called Cuisine de Soy in Tribeca and while sitting beneath the dolphin stuffed and shellacked that hangs over the tofu bar its body bent into an arc Im able to ask the nutritionistquestions like Okay so give me the muffin lowdown without cringing Back at the office two hours later I find out that none of my phones are tapped\\n   I also run into Meredith Powell later this week on Friday night at Ereze with Brock Thompson and though we talk for ten minutes mostly about why neither one of us is in the Hamptons with Brock glaring at me the entire time she doesnt mention Paul Owen once Im having an excruciatingly slow dinner with my date Jeannette The restaurant is flashy and new and the meal inches along drags by The portions are meager I grow increasingly agitated Afterwards I want to bypass MK even though Jeanette complains because she wants to dance Im tired and I need to rest At my apartment I lie in bed too distracted to have sex with her so she leaves and after watching a tape of this morningsPatty Winters Show which is about the best restaurants in the Middle East I pick up my cordless phone and tentatively reluctantly call Evelyn\\n   Summer\\n   Most of the summer I spent in a stupor sitting either in my once or in new restaurants in my apartment watching videotapes or in the backs of cabs in nightclubs that just opened or in movie theaters at the building in Hells Kitchen or in new restaurants There were four major air disasters this summer the majority of them captured on videotape almost as if these events had been planned and repeated on television endlessly The planes kept crashing in slow motion followed by countless roaming shots of the wreckage and the same random views af the burned bloody carnage weeping rescue workers retrieving body parts I started using Oscar de la Renta mens deodorant which gave me a slight rash A movie about a small talking bug was released to great fanfare and grossed over two hundred million dollars The Mets were doing badly Beggars and homeless seemed to have multiplied in August and the ranks of the unfortunate weak and aged lined the streets everywhere I found myself asking too many summer associates at too many dinners in flashy new restaurants before taking them toLes Misrablesif anyone had seenThe Toolbox Murderson HBO and silent tables would stare back at me before I would cough politely and summon the waiter over for the check or Id ask for sorbet or if this was earlier in the dinner for another bottle of San Pellegrino and then Id ask the summer associates No and assure them It was quite good My platinum American Express card had gone through so much use that it snapped in half selfdestructed at one of those dinners when I took two summer associates to Restless and Young the new Pablo Lester restaurant in midtown but I had enough cash in my gazelleskin wallet to pay for the mealThe Patty Winters Shows were all repeats Life remained a blank canvas a clich a soap opera I felt lethal on the verge of frenzy My nightly bloodlust overflowed into my days and I had to leave the city My mask of sanity was a victim of impending slippage This was the bone season for me and I needed a vacation I needed to go to the Hamptons\\n   I suggested this to Evelyn and like a spider she accepted\\n   The house we stayed at was actually Tim Prices which Evelyn had the keys to for some reason but in my stupefied state I refused to ask for specifics\\n   Tims house was on the water in East Hampton and was adorned with many gable roofs and was four stories high all connected by a galvanizedsteel staircase and had what at first I thought was a Southwestern motif but wasnt The kitchen was one thousand square feet of pure minimalist design one wall held everything two huge ovens massive cupboards a walkin freezer a threedoor refrigerator An island of customcrafted stainless steel divided the kitchen into three separate spaces Four of the nine bathrooms contained trompe loeil paintings and five of them had antique lead rams heads that hung over the sink water spouting from their mouths All the sinks and bathtubs and showers were antique marble and the floors were composed of tiny marble mosaics A television was built into a wall alcove above the master bathtub Every room had a stereo The house also contained twelve Frank Lloyd Wright standing lamps fourteen Josef Heffermann club chairs two walls of floortoceiling videocassette cases and another wall stacked solely with thousands of compact discs encased in glass cabinets A chandelier by Eric Schmidt hung in the front entranceway below it stood an Atomic Ironworks steel moose hatrack by a Young sculptor Id never heard of A round nineteenthcentury Russian dining table sat in a room adjacent to the kitchen but had no chairs Spooky photographs by Cindy Sherman lined the walls everywhere There was an exercise room There were eight walkin closets five VCRs a Noguchi glass and walnut dining table a hall table by Marc Schaffer and a fax machine There was a topiary tree in the master bedroom next to a Louis XVI window bench An Eric Fischl painting hung over one of the marble fireplaces There was a tennis court There were two saunas and an indoor Jacuzzi in a small guesthouse that sat by the pool which was blackbottomed There were stone columns in odd places\\n   I really tried to make things work the weeks we were out there Evelyn and I rode bicycles and jogged and played tennis We talked about going to the south of France or to Scotland we talked about driving through Germany and visiting unspoiled opera houses We went windsurfing We talked about only romantic things the light on eastern Long Island the moonrise in October over the hills of the Virginia hunt country We took baths together in the big marble tubs We had breakfast in bed snuggling beneath cashmere blankets after Id poured imported coffee from a Melior pot into Herms cups I woke her up with fresh flowers I put notes in her Louis Vuitton carry bag before she left for her weekly facials in Manhattan I bought her a puppy a small black chow which she named NutraSweet and fed dietetic chocolate trues to I read long passages aloud fromDoctor ZhivagoandA Farewell to Armsmy favorite Hemingway I rented movies in town that Price didnt own mostly comedies from the s and played them on one of the many VCRs our favorite beingRoman Holidaywhich we watched twice We listened to Frank Sinatra only his s period and Nat King ColesAfter Midnightwhich Tim had on CD I bought her expensive lingerie which sometimes she wore\\n   After skinnydipping in the ocean late at night we would come into the house shivering draped in huge Ralph Lauren towels and wed make omelets and noodles tossed with olive oil and truffles and porcini mushrooms wed make souffls with poached pears and cinnamon fruit salads grilled polenta with peppered salmon apple and berry sorbet mascarpone red beans with arrozo wrapped in romaine lettuce bowls of salsa and skate poached in balsamic vinegar chilled tomato soup and risottos flavored with beets and lime and asparagus and mint and we drank lemonade or champagne or wellaged bottles of Chteau Margaux But soon we stopped lifting weights together and wing laps and Evelyn would eat only the dietetic chocolate trues that NutraSweet hadnt eaten complaining about weight she hadnt gained Some nights I would find my self roaming the beaches digging up baby crabs and eating handfuls of sand  this was in the middle of the night when the sky was so clear I could see the entire solar system and the sand lit by it seemed almost lunar in scale I even dragged a beached jellyfish back to the house and microwaved it early one morning predawn while Evelyn slept and what I didnt eat of it I fed to the chow\\n   Sipping bourbon then champagne from cactusetched highball glasses which Evelyn would set on adobe coasters and into which she would stir raspberry cassis with papiermch jalapeoshaped stirrers I would lie around fantasizing about killing someone with an Allsop Racer ski pole or I would stare at the antique weather vane that hung above one of the fireplaces wondering wildeyed if I could stab anyone with it then Id complain aloud whether Evelyn was in the room or not that we should have made reservations at Dick Loudons Stratford Inn instead Evelyn soon started talking only about spas and cosmetic surgery and then she hired a masseur some scary faggot who lived down the road with a famous book publisher and who flirted openly with me Evelyn went back to the city three times that last week we were in the Hamptons once for a manicure and a pedicure and a facial the second time for a oneonone training session at Stephanie Herman and finally to meet with her astrologer\\n   Why helicopter in I asked in a whisper\\n   What do you want me to do she shrieked popping another dietetic true into her mouth Rent aVolvo\\n   While she was gone I would vomit just to do it  into the rustic terracotta jars that lined the patio in front or I would drive into town with the scary masseur and collect razor blades At night Id place a fauxconcrete and aluminumwire sconce by Jerry Kott over Evelyns head and since shed be so knocked out on Halcion she wouldnt brush it off and though I laughed at this while the sconce rose evenly with her deep breathing soon it made me sad and I stopped placing the sconce over Evelyns head\\n   Everything failed to subdue me Soon everything seemed dull another sunrise the lives of heroes falling in love war the discoveries people made about each other The only thing that didnt bore me obviously enough was how much money Tim Price made and yet in its obviousness it did There wasnt a clear identifiable emotion within me except for greed and possibly total disgust I had all the characteristics of a human being flesh blood skin hair  but my depersonalization was so intense had gone so deep that the normal ability to feel compassion had been eradicated the victim of a slow purposeful erasure I was simply imitating reality a rough resemblance of a human being with only a dim corner of my mind functioning Something horrible was happening and yet I couldnt figure out why  I couldnt put my finger on it The only thing that calmed me was the satisfying sound of ice being dropped into a glass of JB Eventually I drowned the chow which Evelyn didnt miss she didnt even notice its absence not even when I threw it in the walkin freezer wrapped in one of her sweaters from Bergdorf Goodman We had to leave the Hamptons because I would find myself standing over our bed in the hours before dawn with an ice pick gripped in my fist waiting for Evelyn to open her eyes At my suggestion one morning over breakfast she agreed and on the last Sunday before Labor Day we returned to Manhattan by helicopter\\n   Girls\\n   I thought the pinto beans with salmon and mint were really really you know Elizabeth says walking into the living room of my apartment and in one graceful movement kicking off both satin and suede Maud Frizon pumps and flopping onto the couch good but Patrick my god it was expensiveand then bristling she bitches it was onlypseudo nouvelle\\n   Was it my imagination or were there goldfish on the tables I ask undoing my Brooks Brothers suspenders while searching the refrigerator for a bottle of sauvignon blanc Anyway Ithought it was hip\\n   Christie has taken a seat on the long wide sofa away from Elizabeth who stretches out lazily\\n   Hip Patrick she calls out DonaldTrumpeats there\\n   I locate the bottle and stand it on the counter and before finding a wine opener stare at her blankly from across the room Yes Is this a sarcastic comment\\n   Guess she moans and follows it with a Duh so loud that Christie flinches\\n   Where are you working now Elizabeth I ask closing drawers Polo outlet or something\\n   Elizabeth cracks up at this and says blithely while I uncork the Acacia I dont have to work Bateman and after a beat she adds bored You of all people should know howthatfeels Mr Wall Street Shes checking her lipstick in a Gucci compact predictably it looks perfect\\n   Changing the subject I ask Who chose that place anyway I pour the two girls wine and then make myself a JB on the rocks with a little water The restaurant I mean\\n   Carson did Or maybe Robert Elizabeth shrugs and then after snapping the compact shut staring intently at Christie asks You look really familiar Did you go to Dalton\\n   Christie shakes her head no Its almost three in the morning Im grinding up a tab of Ecstasy and watching it dissolve in the wineglass I plan to hand Elizabeth This mornings topic onThe Patty Winters Showwas People Who Weigh Over Seven Hundred Pounds What Can We Do About Them I switch on the kitchen lights find two more tabs of the drug in the freezer then shut the lights off\\n   Elizabeth is a twentyyearold hardbody who sometimes models in Georges Marciano ads and who comes from an old Virginia banking family We had dinner earlier tonight with two friends of hers Robert Farrell twentyseven a guy whos had a rather sketchy career as a financier and Carson Whitall who was Roberts date Robert wore a wool suit by Belvest a cotton shirt with French cuffs by Charvet an abstractpatterned silkcrepe tie by Hugo Boss and sunglasses by RayBan that he insisted on wearing during the meal Carson wore a suit by Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche and a pearl necklace with matching pearl and diamond earrings by Harry Winston We had dinner at Free Spin the new Albert Lioman restaurant in the Flatiron district then took the limousine to Nells where I excused myself assuring an irate Elizabeth Id be right back and directed the chauffeur to the meatpacking district where I picked up Christie I made her wait in the back of the locked limousine while I reentered Nells and had drinks with Elizabeth and Carson and Robert in one of the booths up front empty since the place had no celebrities in it tonight a bad sign Finally at twothirty while Carson bragged drunkenly about her monthly flower bill Elizabeth and I split She was so pissed off about something Carson told her was in the latest issue ofWthat she didnt even question Christies presence\\n   In the ride back toward Nells Christie had admitted that she was still upset about the last time we shared together and that she had major reservations about tonight but the money Ive offered is simply too good to pass up and I promised her that nothing like last time will be repeated Though she was still scared a few shots of vodka in the back of the limo along with the money Id given her so far over sixteen hundred dollars relaxed her like a tranquilizer Her moodiness turned me on and she acted like a total sex kitten when I first handed her the cash amount six bills attached to a Hughlans silver money clip  but after I urged her into the limo she told me that she might need surgery after what happened last time or a lawyer so I wrote out a check to cash in the amount of one thousand dollars but since I knew it would never be cashed I didnthave a panic attack about it or anything Looking over at Elizabeth right now in my apartment Im noticing how well endowed she is in the chest area and Im hoping that after the Ecstasy hits her system I can convince the two girls to have sex in front of me\\n   Elizabeth is asking Christie if shes ever met some asshole named Spicey or been to Au Bar Christie is shaking her head I hand Elizabeth the Ecstasyladen sauvignon blanc while she stares at Christie like she was from Neptune and after recovering from Christies admission she yawns Anyway Au Barsucksnow Its terrible I went to a birthday party there for Malcolm Forbes Oh my godplease She downs the wine facing I take a seat in one of the chrome and oak Sottsass chairs and reach over to the ice bucket that sits on the glasstop coffee table adjusting the bottle of wine in order to chill it better Immediately Elizabeth makes a move for it pouring herself another glass I dissolve two more tabs of the Ecstasy in the bottle before bringing it into the living room A sullen Christie sips her untainted wine cautiously and tries not to stare at the floor she still seems scared and finding the silence unbearable or incriminating she asks Elizabeth where she met me\\n   Oh god Elizabeth starts moaning as if she falsely remembered something embarrassing I met Patrick at oh god the Kentucky Derby in  no  and She turns to me You were hanging out with that bimbo Alison something Stoole\\n   Poole honey I reply calmly Alison Poole\\n   Yeah that was her name she says then with unmasked sarcasm Hot number\\n   What do you mean by that I ask offended Shewas a hot number\\n   Elizabeth turns to Christie and unfortunately says if you had an American Express card shed give you a blow job and Im hoping to god that Christie doesnt look over at Elizabeth confused and say But we dont take credit cards To make sure this doesnt happen I bellow Oh bullshit but goodnaturedly\\n   Listen Elizabeth tells Christie holding her hand out like a fag offering gossipy information This girl worked at a tanning salon and and in the same sentence without changing tone  what do you do\\n   After a long silence Christie turning redder and even more scared I say Shes my cousin\\n   Slowly Elizabeth takes this in and says Uhhuh\\n   After another long silence I say Shes from France\\n   Elizabeth looks at me skeptically like Im completely crazy but chooses not to pursue this line of questioning and asks instead Wheres your phone Ivegot to call Harley\\n   I move over to the kitchen and bring the cordless phone to her pulling up its antenna She dials a number and while waiting for someone to answer stares at Christie Where do you summer she asks Southampton\\n   Christie looks at me and then back at Elizabeth and quietly says No\\n   Ohgod Elizabeth wails its hismachine\\n   Elizabeth I point at my Rolex Itsthreein the morning\\n   Hes a goddamndrug dealer she says exasperated These are his peak hours\\n   Dont tell him youre here I warn\\n   Why would I she asks Distracted she reaches for her wine and downs another full glass and makes a face This tastes weird She checks the label then shrugs Harley Its me I need your services Translate that any way youd like Im at She looks over at me\\n   Youre at Marcus Halberstams I whisper\\n   Who Leaning in she grins mischievously\\n   Marcus Halberstam I whisper again\\n   I want thenumber idiot She waves me away and continues Anyway Im at Mark Hammersteins and Ill try you later and if I dont see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night Im going to sic my hairdresser on you Bon voyage How do I hang this thing up she asks even though she expertly pushes the antenna down and presses the Off button tossing the phone onto the Schrager chair that Ive moved next to the jukebox\\n   See I smile You did it\\n   Twenty minutes later Elizabeth is squirming on the couch and Im trying to coerce her into having sex with Christie in front of me What started out as a casual suggestion is now at the forefront of my brain and Im insistent Christie stares impassively at a stain I hadnt noticed on the whiteoak floor her wine mostly untouched\\n   But Imnota lesbian Elizabeth protests again giggling Imnotinto girls\\n   Is this a firmno I ask staring at her glass then at the nearempty bottle of wine\\n   Whyd you think Id be into that she asks Because of the Ecstasy the question is flirtatious and she seems genuinely interested Her foot is rubbing against my thigh Ive moved over to the couch sitting between the two girls and Im massaging one of her calves\\n   Well you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing I tell her You never know\\n   Those are Sarah Lawrenceguys Patrick she points out giggling rubbing harder causing friction heat everything\\n   Well Im sorry  I admit I dont usually deal with a lot of guys who wear panty hose on the Street\\n   Patrickyouwent to Patrick I mean Harvard oh god Imsodrunk Anyway listen I mean wait She pauses taken a deep breath mumbles an unintelligible remark about feeling bizarre then after closing her eyes opens them and asks Do you have any coke\\n   Im staring at her glass noticing that the dissolved Ecstasy has slightly changed the color of the wine She follows my gaze and takes a gulp of it as if it were some kind of elixir that could soothe her increasing agitation She leans her head back woozily on one of the pillows on the couch Or Halcion Id take a Halcion\\n   Listen I would just like to see the two of you get it on I say innocently Whats wrong with that Its totally diseasefree\\n   Patrick She laughs Youre a lunatic\\n   Come on I urge Dont you find Christie attractive\\n   Lets not get lewd she says but the drug is kicking in and I can sense that shes excited but doesnt want to be Im in no mood to have lewd conversation\\n   Come on I say I think it would be a turnon\\n   Does he do this all the time Elizabeth asks Christie\\n   I look over at Christie\\n   Christie shrugs noncommittal and studies the back of a compact disc before setting it on the table next to the stereo\\n   Are you telling me youve never gotten it on with a girl I ask touching a black stocking then beneath it a leg\\n   But Imnota lesbian she stresses And no I never have\\n   Never I ask arching my eyebrows Well theres always a first time\\n   Youre making me feel weird Elizabeth moans losing control of her facial features\\n   Imnot I say shocked\\n   Elizabeth is making out with Christie both of them naked on my bed all the lights in the room burning while I sit in the Louis Montoni chair by the side of the futon watching them very closely occasionally repositioning their bodies Now I make Elizabeth lie on her back and hold both legs up open spreading them as wide as possible and then I push Christies head down and make her lap at her cunt not suck on it but lap at it like a thirsty dog  while fingering the clit then with her other hand she sticks two fingers into the open wet cunt while her tongue replaces the fingers and then she takes the dripping fingers shes fucked Elizabeths cunt with and forces them into Elizabeths mouth making her suck on them Then I have Christie lie on top of Elizabeth and make her suck and bite at Elizabeths full swollen tits which Elizabeth is also squeezing and then I tell the two of them to kiss each other hard and Elizabeth takes the tongue thats been licking at her own small pink cunt into her mouth hungrily like an animal and uncontrollably they start humping each other pressing their cunts together Elizabeth moaning loudly wrapping her legs around Christies hips bucking up against her Christies legs spread in such a way that from behind I can see her cunt wet and spread and above it her hairless pink asshole\\n   Christie sits up and turns herself around and while still on top of Elizabeth presses her cunt into Elizabeths gasping face and soon like in a movie like animals the two of them start feverishly licking and fingering each others cunts Elizabeth totally redfaced her neck muscles straining like a madwomans tries to bury her head in Christies pussy and then spreads Christies ass cheeks open and starts tonguing the hole there making guttural sounds Yeah I say in monotone Stick your tongue up that bitchs asshole\\n   While this is going on Im greasing with Vaseline a large white dildo thats connected to a belt I stand up and hoist Christie off Elizabeth who is writhing mindlessly on the futon and I attach the belt around Christies waist and then I turn Elizabeth around and position her on all fours and I make Christie fuck her with it doggy style while I finger Christies cunt then her clit then her asshole which is so wet and loose from Elizabeths saliva Im able to force my index finger into it effortlessly and her sphincter tightens relaxes then contracts around it I make Christie pull the dildo out of Elizabeths cunt and have Elizabeth lie on her back while Christie fucks her in the missionary position Elizabeth is fingering her clit while madly Frenchkissing Christie until involuntarily she brings her head back legs wrapped around Christies pumping hips her face tense her mouth open her lipstick smeared by Christies cunt juice and she yells oh god Im coming Im coming fuck me Im coming because I told both of them to let me know when they had orgasms and to be very vocal about it\\n   Soon its Christies turn and Elizabeth eagerly straps on the dildo and fucks Christies cunt with it while I spread Elizabeths asshole and tongue it and soon she pushes me away and starts fingering herself desperately Then Christie puts the dildo on again and she fucks Elizabeth in the ass with it while Elizabeth fingers her clit bucking her ass up against the dildo grunting until she has another orgasm After pulling the dildo from her ass I make Elizabeth suck on it before she straps it on again and while Christie lies on her back Elizabeth pushes it easily into her cunt During this I lick Christies tits and suck hard on each nipple until both of them are red and stiff I keep fingering them to make sure they stay that way During this Christie has kept on a pair of thighhigh suede boots from Henri Bendel that Ive made her wear\\n   Elizabeth naked running from the bedroom blood already on her is moving with difficulty and she screams out something garbled My organ had been prolonged and its release was intense and my knees are weak Im naked too shouting You bitch you piece of bitch trash at her and since most of the blood is coming from her feet she slips manages to get up and I strike out at her with the already wet butcher knife that Im gripping in my right hand clumsily slashing her neck from behind severing something some veins When I strike out a second time while shes trying to escape heading for the door blood shoots even into the living room across the apartment splattering against the tempered glass and the laminated oak panels in the kitchen She tries to run forward but Ive cut her jugular and its spraying everywhere blinding both of us momentarily and Im leaping at her in a final attempt to finish her off She turns to face me her features twisted in anguish and her legs give out after I punch her in the stomach and she hits the floor and I slide in next to her After Ive stabbed her five or six times the bloods spurting out in jets Im leaning over to inhale its perfume  her muscles stiffen become rigid and she goes into her death throes her throat becomes flooded with darkred blood and she thrashes around as if tied up but she isnt and I have to hold her down Her mouth fills with blood that cascades over the sides of her cheeks over her chin Her body shaking spasmodically resembles what I imagine an epileptic goes through in a fit and I hold down her head rubbing my dick stiff covered with blood across her choking face until shes motionless\\n   Back in my bedroom Christie lies on the futon tied to the legs of the bed bound up with rope her arms above her head ripped pages from last monthsVanity Fair stuffed into her mouth Jumper cables hooked up to a battery are clipped to both breasts turning them brown I had been dropping lit matches from Le Relais onto her belly and Elizabeth delirious and probably overdosing on the Ecstasy had been helping before I turned on her and chewed at one of her nipples until I couldnt control myself and bit it off swallowing For the first time I notice just how small and delicately structured Christie is was I start kneading her breasts with a pair of pliers then Im mashing them up things are moving fast Im making hissing noises she spits out the pages from the magazine tries to bite my hand I laugh when she dies before she does she starts crying then her eyes roll back in some kind of horrible dream state\\n   In the morning for some reason Christies battered hands are swollen to the size of footballs the fingers are indistinguishable from the rest of her hand and the smell coming from her burnt corpse is jolting and I have to open the venetian blinds which are spattered with burnt fat from when Christies breasts burst apart electrocuting her and then the windows to air out the room Her eyes are wide open and glazed over and her mouth is lipless and black and theres also a black pit where her vagina should be though I dont remember doing anything to it and her lungs are visible beneath the charred ribs What is left of Elizabeths body lies crumpled in the corner of the living room Shes missing her right arm and chunks of her right leg Her left hand chopped off at the wrist lies clenched on top of the stand in the kitchen in its own small pool of blood Her head sits on the kitchen table and its bloodsoaked face even with both eyes scooped out and a pair of Alain Mikli sunglasses over the holes  looks like its frowning I get very tired looking at it and though I didnt get any sleep last night and Im utterly spent I still have a lunch appointment at Odeon with Jem Davies and Alana Burton at oneThats very important to me and I have to debate whether I should cancel it or not\\n   Confronted by Faggot\\n   Autumn a Sunday around four oclock in the afternoon Im at Barneys buying cuff links I had walked into the store at twothirty after a cold tense brunch with Christies corpse rushed up to the front counter told a salesclerk I need a whip Really In addition to the cuff links Ive bought an ostrich travel case with doublezippered openings and vinyl lining an antique silver crocodile and glass pill jar an antique toothbrush container a badgerbristle toothbrush and a fauxtortoiseshell nailbrush Dinner last night At Splash Not much to remember a watery Bellini soggy arugula salad a sullen waitress Afterwards I watched a repeat of an oldPatty Winters Showthat I found on what I originally thought was a videotape of the torture and subsequent murder of two escort girls from last spring the topic was Tips on How Your Pet Can Become a Movie Star Right now Im in the middle of purchasing a belt not for myself  as well as three ninetydollar ties ten handkerchiefs a fourhundreddollar robe and two pairs of Ralph Lauren pajamas and Im having it all mailed to my apartment except for the handkerchiefs which Im having monogrammed then sent to P P Ive already made somewhat of a scene in the ladies shoe department and embarrassingly was chased out by a distressed salesperson At first its only a sense of vague uneasiness and Im unsure of its cause but then it feels though I cant be positive as if Im being followed as if someone has been tracking me throughout Barneys\\n   Luis Carruthers is I suppose incognito Hes wearing some kind of jaguarprint silk evening jacket deerskin gloves a felt hat aviator sunglasses and hes hiding behind a column pretending to inspect a row of ties and gracelessly he gives me a sidelong glance Leaning down I sign something a bill I think and fleetingly Luiss presence forces me to consider that maybe a life connected to this city to Manhattan to my job is not a good idea and suddenly I imagine Luis at some horrible party drinking a nice dry ros fags clustered around a baby grand show tunes now hes holding a flower now he has a feather boa draped around his neck now the pianist bangs out something fromLes Miz darling\\n   Patrick Is that you I hear a tentative voice inquire\\n   Like a smash cut from a horror movie a jump zoom  Luis Carruthers appears suddenly without warning from behind his column slinking and jumping at the same time if thats possible I smile at the salesgirl then awkwardly move away from him and over to a display case of suspenders in dire need of a Xanax a Valium a Halcion a Frozfruitanything\\n   I dontcant look at him but I sense hes moved closer to me His voice confirms it\\n   Patrick Hello\\n   Closing my eyes I move a hand up to my face and mutter under my breath Dont make me say it Luis\\n   Patrick he says feigning innocence What do you mean\\n   A hideous pause then Patrick Why arent you looking at me\\n   Im ignoring you Luis I breathe in calming myself by checking the price tag on an Armani buttonup sweater Cant you tell Im ignoring you\\n   Patrick cant we just talk he asks almost whining Patrick look at me\\n   After another sharp intake of breath sighing I admit There isnothing nothing to talk\\n   We cant go on like this he impatiently cuts me off Ican go onlikethis\\n   I mutter I start walking away from him He follows insistent\\n   Anyway he says once weve reached the other side of the store where I pretend to look through a row of silk ties but everythings blurry youll be glad to know that Im transferring out of state\\n   Something rises off me and Im able to ask but still without looking at him Where\\n   Oh a different branch he says sounding remarkably relaxed probably due to the fact that I actually inquired about the move In Arizona\\n   Terriffic I murmur\\n   Dont you want to know why he asks\\n   No not really\\n   Because ofyou he says\\n   Dont say that I plead\\n   Because ofyou he says again\\n   You aresick I tell him\\n   If Im sick its because of you he says too casually checking his nails Because of you I am sick and I will not get better\\n   You have distorted this obsession of yours way out of proportion Waywayout of proportion I say then move over to another aisle\\n   But I know you have the same feelings I do Luis says trailing me And I know that just because He lowers his voice and shrugs Just because you wont admit certain feelings you have doesnt mean you dont have them\\n   What are you trying to say I hiss\\n   That I know you feel the same way I do Dramatically he whips off his sunglasses as if to prove a point\\n   You have reached an inaccurate conclusion I choke You are obviously unsound\\n   Why he asks Is it so wrong to love you Patrick\\n   Oh my god\\n   Towantyou To want to be with you he asks Is that so wrong\\n   I can feel him staring helplessly into me that hes near total emotional collapse After he finishes except for a long silence I have no answer Finally I counter this by hissing What is this continuing inability you have to evaluate this situation rationally I pause Huh\\n   I lift my head up from the sweaters the ties whatever and glance at Luis In that instant he smiles relieved that Im acknowledging his presence but the smile soon becomes fractured and in the dark inner recesses of his fag mind he realizes something and starts crying When I calmly walk over to a column so I can hide behind it he follows and roughly grabs my shoulder spinning me around so Im facing him Luis blotting out reality\\n   At the same time I ask Luis to Go away he sobs Oh god Patrick why dont youlikeme and then unfortunately he falls to the floor at my feet\\n   Get up I mutter standing there Get up\\n   Why cant we be together he sobs pounding his fist on the floor\\n   Because I dont  I look around the store quickly to make sure no one is listening he reaches for my knee I brush his hand away  find you sexually attractive I whisper loudly staring down at him I cant believe I actually said that I mumble to myself to no one and then shake my headtrying to clear it things reaching a level of confusion that Im incapable of registering I tell Luis Leave me alone please and I start to walk away\\n   Unable to grasp this request Luis grabs at the hem of my Armani silkcloth trench coat and still lying on the floor cries out Please Patrick pleasedont leave me\\n   Listen to me I tell him kneeling down trying to haul Luis up off the floor But this causes him to shout out something garbled which turns into a wail that rises and reaches a crescendo that catches the attention of a Barneys security guard standing by the stores front entrance who starts making his way over\\n   Look what youve done I whisper desperately Get upGet up\\n   Is everything okay The security guard a big black guy is looking down at us\\n   Yes thank you I say glaring at Luis Everythingsfine\\n   Noooo Luis wails racked with sobs\\n   Yes I reiterate looking up at the guard\\n   You sure the guard asks\\n   Smiling professionally I tell him Please just give us a minute We need some privacy I turn back to Luis Now come on Luis Get up Youre slobbering I look back up at the security guard and mouth holding up a hand while nodding Just a minute please\\n   The security guard nods unsurely and moves hesitantly back to his post\\n   Still kneeling I grab Luis by his heaving shoulders and calmly tell him my voice lowered as threatening as possible as if speaking to a child about to be punished Listen to me Luis If you do not stop crying you fucking patheticfaggotI am going to slit your fucking throat Are you listening to me I slap him lightly on the face a couple of times I cant be more emphatic\\n   Oh just kill me he wails his eyes closed nodding his head back and forth retreating further into incoherence then he blubbers If I cant have you I dont want to live I want todie\\n   My sanity is in danger of fading right here in Barneys and I grab Luis by the collar scrunching it up in my fist and pulling his face very close to mine I whisper under my breath Listen to me Luis Are you listening to me I usually dont warn people Luis SobethankfulIamwarningyou\\n   His rationality shot to hell making guttural noises his head bent down shamefully he offers a response thats barely audible I grab his hair its stiff with mousse I recognize the scent as Cactus a new brand  and yanking his head up snarling I spit out Listen youwanttodieIll do it Luis Ive done it before and I will fuckinggutyouripyour fucking stomach open and cram your intestines down your fucking faggot throat until youchokeon them\\n   Hes not listening Still on my haunches I just stare at him in disbelief\\n   Please Patrick please Listen to me Ive figured it all out Im quitting P P you can too and and and well relocate to Arizona and then\\n   Shut up Luis I shake him Oh my god just shut up I quickly stand brushing myself off and when I think his outburst has subsided and Im able to walk away Luis grabs at my right ankle and tries to hang on as Im leaving Barneys and I end up dragging him along for six feet before I have to kick him in the face while smiling helplessly at a couple who are browsing near the sock department Luis looks up at me imploring the beginnings of a small gash forming on his left cheek The couple move away\\n   I love you he miserably wails I love you\\n   Imconvinced Luis I shout at him Youveconvincedme Now get up\\n   Luckily a salesperson alarmed by the scene Luis has made intervenes and helps him up\\n   A few minutes later after hes sufficiently calmed down the two of us are standing just inside Barneys main entrance He has a handkerchief in one hand his eyes are shut tightly a bruise slowly forms swelling beneath his left eye He seems composed\\n   Just you know have the guts to face uh reality I tell him\\n   Anguished he stares out the revolving doors at the warm falling rain and then with a mournful sigh turns to me Im looking at the rows the endless rows of ties then at the ceiling\\n   Killing Child at Zoo\\n   A string of days pass During the nights Ive been sleeping in twentyminute intervals I feel aimless things look cloudy my homicidal compulsion which surfaces disappears surfaces leaves again lies barely dormant during a quiet lunch at Alex Goes to Camp where I have the lamb sausage salad with lobster and white beans sprayed with lime and foie gras vinegar Im wearing faded jeans an Armani jacket and a white hundredandfortydollar Comme des Garons Tshirt I make a phone call to check my messages I return some videotapes I stop at an automated teller Last night Jeanette asked me Patrick why do you keep razor blades in your walletThe Patty Winters Show this morning was about a boy who fell in love with a box of soap\\n   Unable to maintain a credible public persona I find myself roaming the zoo in Central Park restlessly Drug dealers hang out along the perimeter by the gates and the smell of horse shit from passing carriages drifts over them into the zoo and the tips of skyscrapers apartment buildings on Fifth Avenue the Trump Plaza the ATT building surround the park which surrounds the zoo and heightens its unnaturalness A black custodian mopping the floor in the mens room asks me to flush the urinal after I use it Do it yourself nigger I tell him and when he makes a move toward me the flash of a knifeblade causes him to back off All the information booths seem closed A blind man chews feeds on a pretzel Two drunks faggots console each other on a bench Nearby a mother breastfeeds her baby which awakens something awful in me\\n   The zoo seems empty devoid of life The polar bears look stained and drugged A crocodile floats morosely in an oily makeshift pond The puffins stare sadly from their glass cage Toucans have beaks as sharp as knives The seals stupidly dive off rocks into swirling black water barking mindlessly The zookeepers feed them dead fish A crowd gathers around the tank mostly adults a few accompanied by children On the seals tank a plaque warns COINS CAN KILL IF SWALLOWED COINS CAN LODGE IN AN ANIMALS STOMACH AND CAUSE ULCERS INFECTIONS AND DEATH DO NOT THROW COINS IN THE POOL So what do I do Toss a handful of change into the tank when none of the zookeepers are watching Its not the seals I hate  its the audiences enjoyment of them thatbothers me The snowy owl has eyes that look just like mine especially when it widens them And while I stand there staring at it lowering my sunglasses something unspoken passes between me and the bird  theres this weird kind of tension a bizarre pressure that fuels the following which starts happens ends very quickly\\n   In the darkness of the penguin habitat Edge of the Icepack is what the zoo pretentiously calls it  its cool in sharp contrast to the humidity outside The penguins in the tank glide lazily underwater past the glass walls where spectators crowd in to stare The penguins on the rocks not swimming look dazed stressed out tiredand bored they mostly yawn sometimes stretching Fake penguin noises cassettes probably play over a sound system and someone has turned up the volume because its so crowded in the room The penguins are cute I guess I spot one that looks like Craig McDermott\\n   A child barely five finishes eating a candy bar His mother tells him to throw the wrapper away then resumes talking to another woman who is with a child around the same age the three of them staring into the dirty blueness of the penguin habitat The first child moves toward the trash can located in a dim corner in the back of the room that I am now crouching behind He stands on tiptoes carefully throwing the wrapper into the trash I whisper something The child spots me and just stands there away from the crowd slightly scared but also dumbly fascinated I stare back\\n   Would you like a cookie I ask reaching into my pocket\\n   He nods his small head up then down slowly but before he can answer my sudden lack of care crests in a massive wave of fury and I pull the knife out of my pocket and I stab him quickly in the neck\\n   Bewildered he backs into the trash can gurgling like an infant unable to scream or cry out because of the blood that starts spurting out of the wound in his throat Though Id like to watch this child die I push him down behind the garbage can then casually mingle in with the rest of the crowd and touch the shoulder of a pretty girl and smiling I point to a penguin preparing to make a dive Behind me if one were to look closely one could see the childs feet kicking in back of the trash can I keep an eye on the childs mother who after a while notices her sons absence and starts scanning the crowd I touch the girls shoulder again and she smiles at me and shrugs apologetically but I cant figure out why\\n   When the mother finally notices him she doesnt scream because she can see only his feet and assumes that hes playfully hiding from her At first she seems relieved that shes spotted him and moving toward the trash can she coos Are you playing hideandseek honey But from where I stand behind the pretty girl who Ive already found out is foreign a tourist I can see the exact moment when the expression on the mothers face changes into fear and slinging her purse over her shoulder she pulls the trash can away revealing a face completely covered in red blood and the childs having trouble blinking its eyes because of this grabbing at his throat now kicking weakly The mother makes a sound that I cannot describe something highpitched that turns into screaming\\n   After she falls to the floor beside the body a few people turning around I find myself shouting out my voice heavy with emotion Im a doctor move back Im a doctor and I kneel beside the mother before an interested crowd gathers around us and I pry her arms off the child who is now on his back struggling vainly for breath the blood coming evenly but in dying arcs out of his neck and onto his Polo shirt which is drenched with it And I have a vague awareness during the minutes I hold the childs head reverently careful not to bloody myself that if someone makes a phone call or if a real doctor is at hand theres a good chance the child can be saved But this doesnt happen Instead I hold it mindlessly while the mother homely Jewishlooking overweight pitifully trying to appear stylish in designer jeans and an unsightly leafpatterned black wool sweater  shrieksdo something do something do somethingthe two of us ignoring the chaos the people who start screaming around us concentrating only on the dying child\\n   Though I am satisfied at first by my actions Im suddenly jolted with a mournful despair at how useless how extraordinarily painless it is to take a childs life This thing before me small and twisted and bloody has no real history no worthwhile past nothing is really lost Its so much worse and more pleasurable taking the life of someone who has hit his or her prime who has the beginnings of a full history a spouse a network of friends a career whose death will upset far more people whose capacity for grief is limitless than a childs would perhaps ruin many more lives than just the meaningless puny death of this boy Im automatically seized with an almost overwhelming desire to knife the boys mother too who is in hysterics but all I can do is slap her face harshly and shout for her to calm down For this Im given no disapproving looks Im dimly aware of light coming into the room of a door being opened somewhere of the presence of zoo officials a security guard someone one of the tourists  taking flash pictures the penguins freaking out in the tank behind us slamming themselves against the glass in a panic A cop pushes me away even though I tell him Im a physician Someone drags the boy outside lays him on the ground and removes his shirt The boy gasps dies The mother has to be restrained\\n   I feel empty hardly here at all but even the arrival of the police seems an insufficient reason to move and I stand with the crowd outside the penguin habitat with dozens of others taking a long time to slowly blend in and then back away until finally Im walking down Fifth Avenue surprised by how little blood has stained my jacket and I stop in a bookstore and buy a book and then at a Dove Bar stand on the corner of Fiftysixth Street where I buy a Dove Bar a coconut one  and I imagine a hole widening in the sun and for some reason this breaks the tension I started feeling when I first noticed the snowy owls eyes and then when it recurred after the boy was dragged out of the penguin habitat and I walked away my hands soaked with blood uncaught\\n   Girls\\n   My appearances in the office the last month or so have been sporadic to say the least All I seem to want to do now is work out lifting weights mostly and secure reservations at new restaurants Ive already been to then cancel them My apartment reeks of rotten fruit though actually the smell is caused by what I scooped out of Christies head and poured into a Marco glass bowl that sits on a counter near the entranceway The head itself lies covered with brain pulp hollow and eyeless in the corner of the living room beneath the piano and I plan to use it as a jackolantern on Halloween Because of the stench I decide to use Paul Owens apartment for a little tryst I have planned for tonight Ive had the premises scanned for surveillance devices disappointingly there were none Someone I talk to through my lawyer tells me that Donald Kimball the private investigator has heard that Owen reallyis in London that someone spotted him twice in the lobby of Claridges once each at a tailor on Savile Row and at a trendy new restaurant in Chelsea Kimball flew over two nights ago which means no one is keeping watch over the apartment anymore and the keys I stole from Owen still function so I was able to bring the tools a power drill a bottle of acid the nail gun knives a Bic lighter over there after lunch I hire two escort girls from a reputable if somewhat sleazy private establishment Ive never used before charging them on Owens gold American Express card which I suppose because everyone thinks Owen is now in London no one has put a trace on though there is one on his platinum AmExThe Patty Winters Showtoday was ironically I thought  about Princess Dis beauty tips\\n   Midnight The conversation I have with the two girls both very young blond hardbodies with big tits is brief since Im having a difficult time containing my disordered self\\n   You live in a palace mister one of the girls Torri says in a babys voice awed by Owens ridiculouslooking condo Its a real palace\\n   Annoyed I shoot her a glance Its notthatnice\\n   While making drinks from Owens wellstocked bar I mention to both of them that I work on Wall Street at Pierce Pierce Neither seems particularly interested Again I find myself hearing a voice one of theirs  asking if thats a shoe store Tiffany flips through an issue ofGQthats three months old sitting on the black leather couch beneath the strip of fauxcowhide paneling and shes looking confused like she doesnt understand something anything Im thinking Pray you bitch just pray and then I have to admit to myself what a turnon it is encouraging these girls to debase themselves in front of me for what amounts to pocket change I also mention after pouring them another drink that I went to Harvard and then I ask after a pause Ever hear of it\\n   Im shocked when Torri answers I had a business acquaintance who said he went there She shrugs dumbly\\n   A client I ask interested\\n   Well she starts nervously Lets just say a business acquaintance\\n   Was this a pimp I ask then the weird part happens\\n   Well she stalls again before continuing  lets just call him a business acquaintance She sips from her glass Hesaid he went to Harvard but I didnt believe him She looks over at Tiffany then back at me Our mutual silence encourages her to keep talking and she continues haltingly He had like this monkey And I would have to watch this monkey in his apartment She stops starts continues in monotone occasionally gulping Id want to watch TV all day cause there was nothing else to do while the guy was out and while I tried to keep an eye on the monkey But there was something wrong with this monkey She stops and takes a deep breath The monkey would only watch Again she stops takes in the room aquizzical expression creasing her face as if shes not sure she should be telling us this story if we me and the other bitch should be privy to this information And I brace myself for something shocking something revelatory a connection It would only watch She sighs then in a sudden rush admits The Opnah Winfrey Showand thats all it would watch The guy had tapes and tapes of it and he had made all of them for this monkey now she looks over at me imploringly as if shes losing her mind here right now in Owens apartment and wants me to what verify it  with the commercials edited out One time I tried to turn the channel turn one of the tapes off if I wanted to watch a soap instead or something but  she finishes her drink and rolling her eyes obviously upset by this story continues bravely  the monkey would ssscreech at me and it would only calm down when Oprah was on She swallows clears her throat looks like shes going to cry but doesnt And you know you try to turn the channel and that ddamn monkey would try to scratch you she concludes bitterly and hugs herself shivering uselessly trying to warm herself\\n   Silence Arctic frigid utter silence The light burning over us in the apartment is cold and electric Standing there I look at Torri then at the other girl Tiffany who looks queasy\\n   I finally say something stumbling over my own words I dont care whether youve led a decent life or not\\n   Sex happens a hardcore montage After I shave Torris pussy she lies on her back on Pauls futon and spreads her legs while I finger her and suck it off sometimes licking her asshole Then Tiffany sucks my cock  her tongue is hot and wet and she keeps flicking it over the head irritating me  whileI call her a nasty whore a bitch Fucking one of them with a condom while the other sucks my balls lapping at them I stare at the Angelic silkscreen print hanging over the bed and Im thinking about pools of blood geysers of the stuff Sometimes its very quiet in the room except for the wet sounds my cock makes slipping in and out of one of the girls vaginas Tiffany and I take turns eating Torris hairless cunt and asshole The two of them come yelling simultaneously in a sixtynine position Once their cunts are wet enough I bring out a dildo and let the two of them play with it Torri spreads her legs and fingers her own slit while Tiffany fucks her with the huge greased dildo Torri urging Tiffany to fuck her cunt harder with it until finally gasping she comes\\n   Again I make the two of them eat each other out but it starts failing to turn me on all I can think about is blood and what their blood will look like and though Torri knows what to do how to eat pussy it doesnt subdue me and I push her away from Tiffanys cunt and start licking and biting at the pink soft wet cuntness while Torri spreads her ass and sits on Tiffanys face while fingering her own slit Tiffany hungrily tongues her pussy wet and glistening and Torri reaches down and squeezes Tiffanys big firm tits Im biting hard gnawing at Tiffanys cunt and she starts tensing up Relax I say soothingly She starts squealing trying to pull away and finally she screams as my teeth rip into her flesh Torri thinks Tiffany is coming and grinds her own cunt harder onto Tiffanys mouth smothering her screams but when I look up at Torri blood covering my face meat and pubic hair hanging from my mouth blood pumping from Tiffanys torn cunt onto the comforter I can feel her sudden rush of horror I use Mace to blind both of them momentarily and then I knock them unconscious with the butt of the nail gun\\n   Torri awakens to find herself tied up bent over the side of the bed on her back her face covered with blood because Ive cut her lips off with a pair of nail scissors Tiffany is tied up with six pairs of Pauls suspenders on the other side of the bed moaning with fear totally immobilized by the monster of reality I want her to watch what Im going to do to Torri and shes propped up in a way that makes this unavoidable As usual in an attempt to understand these girls Im filming their deaths With Torri and Tiffany I use a Minox LX ultraminiature camera that takes mm film has a mm f lens an exposure meter and a builtin neutral density filter and sits on a tripod Ive put a CD of the Traveling Wilburys into a portable CD player that sits on the headboard above the bed to mute any screams\\n   I start by skinning Torri a little making incisions with a steak knife and ripping bits of flesh from her legs and stomach while she screams in vain begging for mercy in a high thin voice and Im hoping that she realizes her punishment will end up being relatively light compared to what Ive planned for the other one I keep spraying Torri with Mace and then I try to cut off her fingers with nail scissors and finally I pour acid onto her belly and genitals but none of this comes close to killing her so I resort to stabbing her in the throat and eventually the blade of the knife breaks off in whats left of her neck stuck on bone and I stop While Tiffany watches finally I saw the entire head off torrents of blood splash against the walls even the ceiling  and holding the head up like a prize I take my cock purple with stiffness and lowering Torris head to my lap I push it into her bloodied mouth and start fucking it until I come exploding into it Afterwards Im so hard I can even walk around the bloodsoaked room carrying the head which feels warm and weightless on my dick This is amusing for a while but I need to rest so I remove the head placing it in Pauls oak and teak armoire and then Im sitting in a chair naked covered with blood watching HBO on Owens TV drinking a Corona complaining out loud wondering why Owen doesnt have Cinemax\\n   Later now  Im telling Tiffany Ill let you go shhh and Im stroking her face which is slick owing to tears and Mace gently and it burns me that she actually looks up hopefully for a moment before she sees the lit match Im holding in my hand that Ive torn from a matchbook I picked upin the bar at Palios where I was having drinks with Robert Farrell and Robert Prechter last Friday and I lower it to her eyes which she instinctively closes singeing both eyelashes and brows then I finally use a Bic lighter and hold it up to both sockets making sure they stay open with my fingers burning my thumb and pinkie in the process until the eyeballs burst While shes still conscious I roll her over and spreading her ass cheeks I nail a dildo that Ive tied to a board deep into her rectum using the nail gun Then turning her over again her body weak with fear I cut all the flesh off around her mouth and using the power drill with a detachable massive head I widen that hole while she shakes protesting and once Im satisfied with the size of the hole Ive created her mouth open as wide as possible a reddishblack tunnel of twisted tongue and loosened teeth I force my hand down deep into her throat until it disappears up to my wrist  all the while her head shakes uncontrollably but she cant bite down since the power drill ripped her teeth out of her gums  and grab at the veins lodged there like tubes and I loosen them with my fingers and when Ive gotten a good grip on them violently yank them out through her open mouth pulling until the neck caves in disappears the skin tightens and splits though theres little blood Most of the necks innards including the jugular hang out of her mouth and her whole body starts twitching like a roach on its back shaking spasmodically her melted eyes running down her face mixing with the tears and Mace and then quickly not wanting to waste time I turn off the lights and in the dark before she dies I rip open her stomach with my bare hands I cant tell what Im doing with them but its making wet snapping sounds and my hands are hot and covered with something\\n   The aftermath No fear no confusion Unable to linger since there are things to be done today return videotapes work out at the gym a new British musical on Broadway I promised Jeanette Id take her to a dinner reservation to be made somewhere Whats left of both bodies is in early rigor mortis Part of Tiffanys body I think its her even though Im having a hard time telling the two apart  has sunken in and her ribs jut out most broken in half from whats left of her stomach both breasts having been pierced by them A head has been nailed to the wall fingers lie scattered or arranged in some kind ofcircle around the CD player One of the bodies the one on the floor has been defecated on and seems to be covered with teeth marks where I had bitten into it savagely With the blood from one of the corpses stomachs that I dip my hand into I scrawl in dripping red letters above the fauxcowhide paneling in the living room the words I AM BACK and below it a scary drawing which looks like this\\n

bathroom arrives on Wednesday along with a new Superdeluxe black suede armchair The Onica which Im selling is being replaced by a new one a huge portrait of a graphic equalizer done in chrome and pastels\\n   Im talking to the delivery guys from Park Avenue Sound Shop about HDTV which isnt available yet when one of the new black ATT cordless phones rings I tip them then answer it My lawyer Ronald is on the other end Im listening to him nodding showing the delivery guys out of the apartment Then I say The bill is three hundred dollars Ronald We only had coffee A long pause during which I hear a bizarre sloshing sound coming from the bathroom Walking cautiously toward it cordless phone still in hand I tell Ronald But yes Wait But I am But we only had espresso Then Im peering into the bathroom\\n   Perched on the seat of the toilet is a large wet rat that has Im assuming  come up out of it It sits on the rim of the toilet bowl shaking itself dry before it jumps tentatively to the floor Its a massive rodent and it lurches then scrambles across the tile out of the bathrooms other entrance and into the kitchen where I follow it toward the leftover pizza bag from Le Madri that for some reason sits on the floor on top of yesterdaysNew York Timesnear the garbage pail from Zona and the rat lured by the smell takes the bag in its mouth and shakes its head furiously like a dog would trying to get at the leekgoat cheesetruffle pizza making squealing sounds of hunger Im on a lot of Halcion at this point so the rat doesnt bother me as much as I suppose it should\\n   To catch the rat I buy an extralarge mousetrap at a hardware store on Amsterdam I also decide to spend the night at my familys suite in the Carlyle The only cheese I have in the apartment is a wedge of Brie in the refrigerator and before leaving I place the entire slice its a really big rat  along with a sundried tomato and a sprinkling of dill delicately on the trap setting it But when I come back the following morning because of the rats size the trap hasnt killed it The rat just lies there stuck squeaking thrashing its tail which is a horrible oily translucent pink as long as a pencil and twice as thick and it makes a slapping sound every time it hits against the white oak floor Using a dustpan  which it takes me over a fucking hour to find  I corner the injured rat just as it frees itself from the trap and I pick the thingup sending it into a panic making it squeal even louder hissing at me baring its sharp yellow rat fangs and dump it into a Bergdorf Goodman hatbox But then the thing claws its way out and I have to keep it in the sink a board heavy with unused cookbooks covering it and even then it almost escapes while I sit in the kitchen thinking of ways to torture girls with this animal unsurprisingly I come up with a lot making a list that includes unrelated to the rat cutting open both breasts and deflating them along with stringing barbed wire tightly around their heads\\n   Another Night\\n   McDermott and I are supposed to have dinner tonight at  and he calls me around sixthirty forty minutes before our actual reservation he couldnt get us in at any other time except for sixten or nine which is when the restaurant closes it serves Californian cuisine and its seating times are an affectation carried over from that state and though Im in the middle of flossing my teeth all of my cordless phones lie by the sink in the bathroom and Im able to pick the right one up on the second ring So far Im wearing black Armani trousers a white Armani shirt a red sad black Armani tie McDermott lets me know that Hamlin wants to come with us Im hungry Theres a pause\\n   So I ask straightening my tie Okay\\n   So McDermott sighs Hamlin doesnt want to go to \\n   Why not I turn off the tap in the sink\\n   He wastherelast night\\n   So what areyou McDermott trying to tell me\\n   That weregoingsomeplace else he says\\n   Where I ask cautiously\\n   Alex Goes to Camp is whereHamlin suggested he says\\n   Hold on Im Plaxing After swishing the antiplaque formula around in my mouth and inspecting my hairline in the mirror I spit out the Plax Veto BypassI wenttherelast week\\n   IknowSo did I McDermott says Besides its cheap So where do we go instead\\n   Didnt Hamlin have a fucking backup I growl irritated\\n   Erno\\n   Call him back and get one I say walking out of the bathroom I seem to have misplaced my Zagat\\n   Do you want to hold or should I call you back he asks\\n   Call me back bozo We hang up\\n   Minutes pass The phone rings I dont bother screening it Its McDermott again\\n   Well I ask\\n   Hamlin doesnt have a backup and he wants to invite Luis Carruthers and what I want to know is does this mean Courtneys coming McDermott asks\\n   Luis cannotcome I say\\n   Why not\\n   He justcant I ask Why does he want Luis to come\\n   Theres a pause Hold on McDermott says Hes on the other line Ill ask him\\n   Who A flash of panic Luis\\n   Hamlin\\n   While holding I move into the kitchen over to the refrigerator and take out a bottle of Perrier Im looking for a glass when I hear a click\\n   Listen I say when McDermott gets back on the line I dont want to see Luisor Courtney so you know dissuade them or something Use your charm Be charming\\n   Hamlin has to have dinner with a client from Texas and\\n   I cut him off Wait this has nothing to do with Luis Let Hamlin take the fag out himself\\n   Hamlin wants Carruthers to come because Hamlin is supposed to be dealing with the Panasonic case but Carruthers knows a lot more about it and thats why he wants Carruthers to come McDermott explains\\n   I pause while taking this in If Luis comes Ill kill him I swear to god Ill kill him Ill fucking kill him\\n   Jeez Bateman McDermott murmurs concerned Youre a real humanitarian A sage\\n   No just I start confused irritated Just sensible\\n   I just want to know if Luis comes does this mean that Courtney will come too he wonders again\\n   Tell Hamlin to invite oh shit I dont know I stop Tell Hamlin to have dinner with the Texas guy alone I stop again realizing something Wait a minute Does this mean Hamlin will takeusout I mean pay for it since its a business dinner\\n   You know sometimes I think youre very smart Bateman McDermott says Other times\\n   Oh shit what the hell am I saying I ask myself out loud annoyed You and I can have a goddamnbusiness dinner together Jesus Im not going Thats it Im not going\\n   Not even if Luisdoesntcome he asks\\n   No Nope\\n   Why not he whines Wehavereservations at \\n   I have to watchThe Cosby Show\\n   Ohtape it for Christ sakes youass\\n   Wait Ive realized something else Do you think Hamlin will I pause awkwardly  have some drugs perhaps for the Texan\\n   What does Bateman think McDermott asks the jaded asshole\\n   Hmmm Im thinking about it Im thinking about this\\n   After a pause McDermott says Ticktock ticktock in singsong Were getting nowhere OfcourseHamlin is going to be carrying\\n   Get Hamlin have him get him on threeway I sputter checking my Rolex Hurry Maybe we can talk him into \\n   Okay McDermott says Hold on\\n   There are four clicking noises and then I hear Hamlin saying Bateman is it okay to wear argyle socks with a business suit Hes attempting a joke but it fails to amuse me\\n   Sighing inwardly my eyes closed I answer impatient Not really Hamlin Theyre too sporty They interfere with a business image You can wear them with casual suits Tweeds whatever Now Hamlin\\n   Bateman And then he says Thank you\\n   Luiscannotcome I tell him And youre welcome\\n   No prob he says The Texans not coming anyway\\n   Why not I ask\\n   Hay letsyall go to See Bee Jee Bees I har thats pretty new wave Lifestyle difference Hamlin explains The Texan is not accepted until Monday I quickly and quite nimbly I might add rearranged my hectic schedule A sick father A forest fire An excuse\\n   How does that take care of Luis I ask suspiciously\\n   Luisis having dinner with the Texan tonight which saves me a whole lotta trouble pardnerIm seeing him at Smith and Wollensky on Monday Hamlin says pleased with himself So everything is Aokay\\n   Wait McDermott asks tentatively does this mean that Courtney isnt coming\\n   We have missed or are going to miss our reservations at  I point out Besides Hamlin you went there last night huh\\n   Yeah he says Its got passable carpaccio Decent wren Okay sorbets But lets go somewhere else and uh then go on the search for the uh perfect body Gentlemen\\n   Sounds good I say amused that Hamlin for once has the right idea But what is Cindy going to say about this\\n   Cindy has to go to a charity thing at the Plaza something\\n   Thats theTrumpPlaza I note absently while finally opening the Perrier bottle\\n   Yeah the Trump Plaza he says Something about trees near the library Money for trees or a bush of some kind he says unsure Plants Beats me\\n   So where to McDermott asks\\n   Who cancels  I ask\\n   You do McDermott says\\n   Oh McDermott I moan Just do it\\n   Wait Hamlin says Lets decide where weregoingfirst\\n   Agreed McDermott the parliamentarian\\n   I am fanatically opposed to anywherenoton the Upper West or Upper East side of this city I say\\n   Bellinis Hamlin suggests\\n   Nope Cant smoke cigars there McDermott and I say at the same time\\n   Cross that one out Hamlin says Gandango he suggests\\n   Possibility possibility I murmur mulling it over Trump eats there\\n   Zeus Bar one of them asks\\n   Make a reservation says the other\\n   Wait I tell them Im thinking\\n   Bateman Hamlin warns\\n   Im toying with the idea I say\\n   Bateman\\n   Wait Let me toy for a minute\\n   Im really too irritated to be dealing with this right now McDermott says\\n   Why dont we just forget this shit and bash some Japs Hamlin suggests Thenfind the perfect body\\n   Not a bad idea actually I shrug Decent combo\\n   What doyouwant to do Bateman McDermott asks\\n   Thinking about it thousands of miles away I answer I want to\\n   Yes  they both ask expectantly\\n   I want to pulverize a womans face with a large heavy brick\\n   Besidesthat Hamlin moans impatiently\\n   Okay fine I say snapping out of it Zeus Bar\\n   You sure Right Zeus Bar Hamlin concludes he hopes\\n   Guys I am finding myself increasingly incapable of dealing with thisat all McDermott says Zeus Bar Thats final\\n   Hold on Hamlin says Ill call and make a reservation He clicks off leaving McDermott and myself on hold Its silent for a long time before either one of us says anything\\n   You know I finally say It will probably be impossible to get a reservation there\\n   Maybe we should go to MK The Texan would probably like to go to MK Craig says\\n   But McDermott theTexanisnt coming I point out\\n   I cant go to MK anyway he says not listening and he doesnt mention why\\n   I dont want to know about it\\n   We wait two more minutes for Hamlin\\n   What in the hell is he doing I ask then my call waiting clicks in\\n   McDermott hears it too Do you want to take that\\n   Im thinking It clicks again I moan and tell McDermott to hold on Its Jeanette She sounds tired and sad I dont want to get back on the other line so I ask her what she did last night\\n   After you were supposed to meet me she asks\\n   I pause unsure Uh yeah\\n   We ended up at Palladium which was completely empty They were letting in people for free She signs We saw maybe four or five people\\n   That you knew I ask hopefully\\n   In   the club she says spacing each word out bitterly\\n   Im sorry I finally say I had to return some videotapes And then reacting to her silence You know Iwouldve met you\\n   Idont want to hear about it she sighs cutting me off What are you doing tonight\\n   I pause wondering how to answer before admitting Zeus Bar at nine McDermott Hamlin And then less hopefully Would you like to meet us\\n   I dont know she sighs Without a trace of softness she asks Do you want me to\\n   Must you insist on being so pathetic I ask back\\n   She hangs up on me I get back on the other line\\n   Bateman Bateman Bateman Bateman  Hamlin is droning\\n   Im here Shut the fuck up\\n   Are we still procrastinating McDermott asks Dont procrastinate\\n   Ive decided Id rather play golf I say I havent been golfing in

up Hamlin chortles\\n   My call waiting buzzes again and before I can even decide whether to take it or not Hamlin makes up my mind for me Now if you guys dont want to go to Kaktus\\n   Wait my call

Manhattan I say Im acknowledging you\\n   Hey whats the correct way to wear a cummerbund he asks\\n   I already answered that twice today I warn\\n   The two of them start talking about whether or not Van Patten can get to Kaktus by nine and Ive stopped concentrating on the voices coming through the cordless phone and started watching instead with growing interest the rat Ive bought I still have the mutant one that emerged from the toilet  in its new glass cage heave whats left of its acidridden body halfway across the elaborate Habitrail system that sits on the kitchen table where it attempts to drink from the water holder that I filled with poisoned Evian this morning The scene seems too pitiful to me or not pitiful enough I cant decide A callwaiting noise takes me out of my mindless delirium and I tell Van Patten and McDermott to please hold\\n   I click off then pause before saying You have reached the home of Patrick Bateman Please leave a message after\\n   Oh for

windows the sliding glass door that leads out to the terrace even though its a chilly night midautumn and shes dressed scantily but she has another glass of the Cristal and it seems to warm her enough so that she is able to ask me what I do for a living I tell her that I went to Harvard then started working on Wall Street at Pierce Pierce after I graduated from business school there and when she asks either confused or jokingly Whats that I swallow and with my back to her straightening the new Onica find the strength to force out A shoe store I did a line of cocaine I found in my medicine cabinet when we first came back to my place and the Cristal takes the edge off it but only slightlyThe Patty Winters Showthis morning was about a machine that lets people talk to the dead This girl is wearing a wool barathea jacket and skirt a silk georgette blouse agate and ivory earrings by Stephen Dweck a silk jacquard torsolette vest all from where Charivari Im guessing\\n   In the bedroom shes naked and oiled and sucking my dick and Im standing over her and then Im slapping her in the face with it grabbing her hair with my hand calling her a fucking whore bitch and this turns her on even more and while lamely sucking my cock she starts fingering her clit and when shes asking me Do you like this while licking at the balls Im answering yap yap and breathing hard Her breasts are high and full and firm both nipples very stiff and while shes choking on my cock while Im fucking her mouth roughly with it I reach down to squeeze them and then while Im fucking her after ramming a dildo up her ass and keeping it there with a strap Im scratching at her tits until she warns me to stop Earlier in the evening I was having dinner with Jeanette at a new Northern Italian restaurant near Central Park on the Upper East Side that was very expensive Earlier in the evening I was wearing a suit tailored by Edward Sexton and thinking sadly about my familys house in Newport Earlier in the night after dropping Jeanette off I stopped at MK for a fundraiser that had something to do with Dan Quayle who evenI dont like At MK the girl Im fucking came on to me hard upstairs on a couch while I was waiting to play pool Oh god shes saying Excited I slap her then lightly punch her in the mouth then kiss it biting her lips Fear dread confusion overwhelm her The strap breaks and the dildo slides out of her ass while she tries to push me off I roll away and pretend to let her escape and then while shes gathering her clothes muttering about what a crazy fucking bastard I am I leap out at her jackallike literally foaming at the mouth She cries apologizing sobbing hysterically begging for me not to hurt her in tears covering her breasts now shamefully But even her sobs fail to arouse me I feel little gratification when I Mace her less when I knock her head against the wall four or five times until she loses consciousness leaving a small stain hair stuck to it After she drops to the floor I head for the bathroom and cut another line of the mediocre coke I scored at Nells or Au Bar the other night I can hear a phone ringing an answering machine picking up the call Im bent low over a mirror ignoring the message not even bothering to screen it\\n   Later predictably shes tied to the floor naked on her back both feet both hands tied to makeshift posts that are connected to boards which are weighted down with metal The hands are shot full of nails and her legs are spread as wide as possible A pillow props her ass up and cheese Brie has been smeared across her open cunt some of it even pushed up into the vaginal cavity Shes barely gained consciousness and when she sees me standing over her naked I can imagine that my virtual absence of humanity fills her with mindbending horror Ive situated the body in front of the new Toshiba television set and in the VCR is an old tape and appearing on the screen is the last girl I filmed Im wearing a Joseph Abboud suit a tie by Paul Stuart shoes by J Crew a vest by someone Italian and Im kneeling on the floor beside a corpse eating the girls brain gobbling it down spreading Grey Poupon over hunks of the pink fleshy meat\\n   Can you see I ask the girl not on the television set Can you see this Are you watching I whisper\\n   I try using the power drill on her forcing it into her mouth but shes conscious enough has strength to close her teeth clamping them down and even though the drill goes through the teeth quickly it fails to interest me and so I hold her head up blood dribbling from her mouth and make her watch the rest of the tape and while shes looking at the girl on the screen bleed from almost every possible orifice Im hoping she realizes that this would have happened to her no matter what That she would have ended up lying here on the floor in my apartment hands nailed to posts cheese and broken glass pushed up into her cunt her head cracked and bleeding purple no matter what other choice she might have made that if she had gone to Nells or Indochine or Mars or Au Bar instead of MK if she had simply not taken the cab with me to the Upper West Side that this all would have happened anywayI would have found herThis is the way the earth works I decide not to bother with the camera tonight\\n   Im trying to ease one of the hollow plastic tubes from the dismantled Habitrail system up into her vagina forcing the vaginal lips around one end of it and even with most of it greased with olive oil its not fitting in properly During this the jukebox plays Frankie Valli singing The Worst That Could Happen and Im grimly lipsyncing to it while pushing the Habitrail tube up into this bitchs cunt I finally have to resort to pouring acid around the outside of the pussy so that the flesh can give way to the greased end of the Habitrail and soon enough it slides in easily I hope this hurts you I say\\n   The rat hurls itself against the glass cage as I move it from the kitchen into the living room It refused to eat what was left of the other rat I had bought it to play with last week that now lies dead rotting in a corner of the cage For the last five days Ive purposefully starved it I set the glass cage down next to the girl and maybe because of the scent of the cheese the rat seems to go insane first running in circles mewling then trying to heave its body weak with hunger over the side of the cage The rat doesnt need any prodding and the bent coat hanger I was going to use remains untouched by my side and with the girl still conscious the thing moves effortlessly on newfound energy racing up the tube until half of its body disappears and then after a minute its rat body shaking while it feeds  all of it vanishes except for the tail and I yank the Habitrail tube out of the girl trapping the rodent Soon even the tail disappears The noises the girl is making are for the most part incomprehensible\\n   I can already tell that its going to be a characteristically useless senseless death but then Im used to the horror It seems distilled even now it fails to upset or bother me Im not mourning and to prove it to myself after a minute or two of watching the rat move under her lower belly making sure the girl is still conscious shaking her head in pain her eyes wide with terror and confusion I use a chain saw and in a matter of seconds cut the girl in two with it The whirring teeth go through skin and muscle and sinew and bone so fast that she stays alive long enough to watch me pull her legs away from her body her actualthighswhats left of her mutilated vagina and hold them up in front of me spouting blood like trophies almost Her eyes stay open for a minute desperate and unfocused then close and finally before she dies I force a knife uselessly up her nose until it slides out of the flesh on her forehead and then I hack the bone off her chin She has only half a mouth left and I fuck it once then twice three times in all Not caring whether shes still breathing or not I gouge her eyes out finally using my fingers The rat emerges headfirst  somehow it turned itself around inside the cavity  and its stained with purple bloodI also notice where the chain saw took off about half of its tail and I feed it extra Brie until I feel I have to stomp it to death which I do Later the girls femur and left jawbone lie in the oven baking and tufts of pubic hair fill a Steuben crystal ashtray and when I light them they burnvery quickly\\n   At Another New Restaurant\\n   For a limited period of time Im capable of being halfway cheerful and outgoing so I accept Evelyns invitation to dinner during the first week of November at Luke a new superchic nouvelle Chinese restaurant that also serves oddly enough Creole cuisine We have a good table I reserved under Wintergreens name the simplest of triumphs and I feel anchored calm even with Evelyn sitting across from me prattling on about a very large Faberg egg she thought she saw at the Pierre rolling around the lobby of its own accord or something like that The office Halloween party was at the Royalton last week and I went as a mass murderer complete with a sign painted on my back that read MASS MURDERER which was decidedly lighter than the sandwich board I had constructed earlier that day that read DRILLER KILLER and beneath those two words I had written in bloodYep thats meand the suit was also covered with blood some of it fake most of it real In one fist I clenched a hank of Victoria Bells hair and pinned next to my boutonniere a small white rose was a finger bone Id boiled the flesh off of As elaborate as my costume was Craig McDermott still managed to win first place in the competition He came as Ivan Boesky which I thought was unfair since a lot of people thought Id gone as Michael Milken last yearThe Patty Winters Showthis morning was about Home Abortion Kits\\n   The first five minutes after being seated are fine then the drink I ordered touches the table and I instinctively reach for it but I find myself cringing every time Evelyn opens her mouth I notice that Saul Steinberg is eating here tonight but refuse to mention this to Evelyn\\n   A toast I suggest\\n   Oh To what she murmurs uninterestedly craning her neck looking around the stark dimly lit very white room\\n   Freedom I ask tiredly\\n   But shes not listening because some English guy wearing a threebutton wool houndstooth suit a tattersall wool vest a spreadcollar cotton oxford shirt suede shoes and a silk tie all by Carrick Anderson whom Evelyn pointed out once after wed had a fight at Au Bar and called gorgeous and whom I had called a dwarf walks over to our table openly flirting with her and it pisses me off to think that she feels Im jealous about this guy but I eventually get the last laugh when he asks if she still has the job at that art gallery on First Avenue and Evelyn clearly stressed her face falling answers no corrects him and after a few awkward words he moves on She sniffs opens her menu immediately starts on about something else without looking at me\\n   What are all these Tshirts Ive been seeing she asks All over the city Have you seen them Silkience Equals Death Are people having problems with their conditioners or something Am I missing something What were we talking about\\n   No thats absolutely wrong ItsScienceEquals Death I sigh close my eyes Jesus Evelyn only you could confusethatand a hair product I have no idea what the hell Im saying but I nod waving to someone at the bar an older man his face covered in shadow someone I only half know actually but he manages to raise his champagne glass my way and smile back which is a relief\\n   Whos that I hear Evelyn asking\\n   Hes a friend of mine I say\\n   I dont recognize him she says P P\\n   Forget it I sigh\\n   Whoisit Patrick she asks more interested in my reluctance than in an actual name\\n   Why I ask back\\n   Who is it she asks Tell me\\n   A friend of mine I say teeth gritted\\n   Who Patrick she asks then squinting Wasnt he at my Christmas party\\n   No he was not I say my hands drumming the tabletop\\n   Isnt it Michael J Fox she asks still squinting The actor\\n   Hardly I say then fed up Oh for Christ sakes his name is George Levanter and no he didnt star inThe Secret of My Success\\n   Oh how interesting Already Evelyn is back poring over the menu Now what were we talking about\\n   Trying to remember I ask Conditioners Or somekindof conditioner I sigh I dont know You were talking to the dwarf\\n   Ian isnota midget Patrick she says\\n   He is unusuallyshortEvelyn I counter Are you surehewasnt at your Christmas party and then my voice lowered  serving hors doeuvres\\n   You cannot keep referring to Ian as a dwarf she says smoothing her napkin over her lap I will not stand for it she whispers not looking at me\\n   I cant restrain myself from snickering\\n   It isnt funny Patrick she says\\n   Youcut the conversation short I point out\\n   Did you expect me to be flattered she spits out bitterly\\n   Listen baby Im just trying to make that encounter seem as legitimate as possible so dont uh you know screw it up for yourself\\n   Just stop it she says ignoring me Oh look its Robert Farrell After waving to him she discreetly points him out to me and sure enough Bob Farrell whom everyone likes is sitting on the north side of the room at a window table which secretly drives me mad Hes very goodlooking Evelyn confides admiringly only because shes noticed me contemplating the twentyyearold hardbody hes sitting with and to make sure Ive registered this she teasingly chirps Hope Im not making you jealous\\n   Hes handsome I admit Stupidlooking but handsome\\n   Dont be nasty Hes very handsome she says and then suggests Why dont you get your hair styled that way\\n   Before this comment I was an automaton only vaguely paying attention to Evelyn but now Im panicked and I ask Whats wrong with my hair In a matter of seconds my rage quadruples What the hell is wrong with my hair I touch it lightly\\n   Nothing she says noticing how upset Ive gotten Just a suggestion and then really noticing how flushed Ive become Your hair looks really really great She tries to smile but only succeeds in looking worried\\n   A sip half a glass  of the JB calms me enough to say looking over at Farrell Actually Im horrified by his paunch\\n   Evelyn studies Farrell too Oh he doesnt have a paunch\\n   Thats definitely a paunch I say Look at it\\n   Thats just the way hes sitting she says exasperated Oh youre\\n   Its apaunchEvelyn I stress\\n   Oh youre crazy She waves me off A lunatic\\n   Evelyn the man isbarelythirty\\n   So what Everyones not into weight lifting like you she says annoyed looking back at the menu\\n   I do not weight lift  I sigh\\n   Oh go over and sock him in the nose then you big bully she says brushing me off I really dont care\\n   Dont tempt me I warn her then looking back at Farrell I mutter What a creep\\n   Oh my god Patrick You have no right to be so embittered Evelyn says angrily still staring into her menu Your animosity is grounded on nothing There must be something really the matter with you\\n   Look at his suit I point out unable to help myself Look at what hes wearing\\n   Oh sowhatPatrick She turns a page finds it has nothing on it and turns back to the page she was previously studying\\n   Hasnt it occurred to him that his suit might inspireloathing I ask\\n   Patrick you are being alunatic she says shaking her head now looking over the wine list\\n   Goddamnit Evelyn What do you meanbeing I say I fuckingamone\\n   Must you be so militant about it she asks\\n   I dont know I shrug\\n   Anyway I was going to tell you what happened to Melania and Taylor and She notices something and in the same sentence adds sighing stop looking at my chest Patrick Look atmenotmy chest Now anyway Taylor Grassgreen and Melania were You know Melania she went to Sweet Briar Her father owns all those banks in Dallas And Taylor went to Cornell Anyway they were supposed to meet at the Cornell Club and then they had a reservation at Mondrian at seven and he was wearing She stops retraces No Le Cygne They were going to Le Cygne and Taylor was She stops again Oh god itwasMondrian Mondrian at seven and he was wearing a Piero Dimitri suit Melania had been shopping I think shed been to Bergdorfs though Im not positive but anyway oh yes itwas Bergdorfs because she was wearing the scarf at the office the other day so anyway she hadnt been to her aerobics class for something like two days and they were mugged on one of\\n   Waiter I call to someone passing by Another drink JB I point to the glass upset that I phrased it as a question rather than a command\\n   Dont you want to find out what happened Evelyn asks displeased\\n   With bated breath I sigh totally uninterested I can hardly wait\\n   Anyway the most amusing thing happened she starts\\n   I am absorbing what you are saying to me Im thinking I notice her lack of carnality and for the first time it taunts me Before it was what attracted me to Evelyn Now its absence upsets me seems sinister fills me with a nameless dread At our last session yesterday in fact  the psychiatrist Ive been seeing for the past two months asked What method of contraception do you and Evelyn use and I sighed before answering my eyes fixed out the window on a skyscraper then at the painting above the Turchin glass coffee table a giant visual reproduction of a graphic equalizer by another artist not Onica Her job When he asked about her preferred sexual act I told him completely serious Foreclosure Dimly aware that if it werent for the people in the restaurant I would take the jade chopsticks sitting on the table and push them deep into Evelyns eyes and snap them in two I nod pretending to listen but Ive already phased out and I dont do the chopsticks thing Instead I order a bottle of the Chassagne Montrachet\\n   Isnt that amusing Evelyn asks\\n   Casually laughing along with her the sounds coming out of my mouth loaded with scorn I admit Riotous I say it suddenly blankly My gaze traces the line of women at the bar Are there any Id like to fuck Probably The longlegged hardbody sipping a kir on the last stool Perhaps Evelyn is agonizing between the mch raisin and gumbosalade or the gratinized beet hazelnut baby greens and endive salad and I suddenly feel like Ive been pumped full of clonopin which is an anticonvulsive but it wasnt doing any good\\n   Christ twenty dollars for a fucking egg roll I mutter studying the menu\\n   Its a moo shu custard lightly grilled she says\\n   Its a fucking egg roll I protest\\n   To which Evelyn replies Youreso cultivated Patrick\\n   No I shrug Just reasonable\\n   Im desperate for some Beluga she says Honey\\n   No I say\\n   Why not she asks pputing\\n   Because I dont want anything out of a can or thats Iranian I sigh\\n   She sniffs haughtily and looks back at the menu The moo foo jambalaya is really firstrate I hear her say\\n   The minutes tick by We order The meal arrives Typically the plate is massive white porcelain two pieces of blackened yellowtail sashimi with ginger lie in the middle surrounded by tiny dots of wasabi which is circled by a minuscule amount of hijiki and on top of the plate sits one lone baby prawn another one even smaller lies curled on the bottom which confuses me since I thought this was primarily a Chinese restaurant I stare at the plate for a long time and when I ask for some water our waiter reappears with a pepper shaker instead and insists on hanging around our table constantly asking us at fiveminute intervals if wed like some pepper perhaps or more pepper and once the fool moves over to another booth whose occupants I can see out of the corner of my eye both cover their plates with their hands I wave the matre d over and ask him Could you please tell the waiter with the pepper shaker to stop hovering over our table We dont want pepper We havent ordered anything thatneeds pepper Nopepper Tell him to get lost\\n   Of course My apologizes The matre d humbly bows\\n   Embarrassed Evelyn asks Must you be so overlypolite\\n   I put down my fork and shut my eyes Why are you constantly undermining my stability\\n   She breathes in Lets just have a conversation Not an interrogation Okay\\n   Aboutwhat I snarl\\n   Listen she says The Young Republican bash at the Pla She stops herself as if remembering something then continues at theTrumpPlaza is next Thursday I want to tell her I cant make it hoping to god she has other plans even though two weeks ago drunk and coked up at Mortimers or Au Bar Iinvitedher for Christ sakes Are we going\\n   After a pause I guess I say glumly\\n   For dessert Ive arranged something special At a power breakfast at the  Club this morning with Craig McDermott Alex Baxter and Charles Kennedy I stole a urinal cake from the mens room when the attendant wasnt looking At home I covered it with a cheap chocolate syrup froze it then placed it in an empty Godiva box tying a silk bow around it and now in Luke when I excuse myself to the rest room I make my way instead to the kitchen after Ive stopped at the coatcheck to retrieve the package and I ask our waiter to present this to the table in the box and to tell the lady seated there that Mr Bateman called up earlier to order this especially for her I even tell him while opening the box to put a flower on it whatever hand him a fifty He brings it over once a suitable amount of time has elapsed after our plates have been removed and Im impressed by what a big deal he makes over it hes even placed a silver dome over the box and Evelyn coos with delight when he lifts it off saying Voira and she makes a move for the spoon hes laid next to her water glass that I make sure is empty and turning to me Evelyn says Patrick thatssosweet and I nod to the waiter smiling and wave him away when he tries to place a spoon on my side of the table\\n   Arent you having any Evelyn asks concerned She hovers over the chocolatedipped urinal cake anxiously poised IadoreGodiva\\n   Im not hungry I say Dinner was filling\\n   She leans down smelling the brown oval and catching a scent of something probably disinfectant asks me now dismayed Are you sure\\n   No darling I say I want you to eat it Theres not a lot there\\n   She takes the first bite chewing dutifully immediately and obviously disgusted then swallows She shudders then makes a grimace but tries to smile as she takes another tentative bite\\n   How is it I ask then urging Eat it Its not poisoned or anything\\n   Her face twisted with displeasure manages to blanch again as if she were gagging\\n   What I ask grinning What is it\\n   Its so Her face is now one long agonized grimace mask and shuddering she coughs minty But she tries to smile appreciatively which becomes an impossibility She reaches for my glass of water and gulps it down desperate to rid her mouth of the taste Then noticing how worried I look she tries to smile this time apologetically Its just  she shudders again  its just sominty\\n   To me she looks like a big black ant a big black ant in an original Christian Lacroix  eating a urinal cake and I almost start laughing but I also want to keep her at ease I dont want her to get second thoughts about finishing the urinal cake But she cant eat any more and with only two bites taken pretending to be full she pushes the tainted plate away and at this moment I start feeling strange Even though I marveled at her eating that thing it also makes me sad and suddenly Im reminded that no matter how satisfying it was to see Evelyn eating something I and countless others had pissed on in the end the displeasure it caused her was atmyexpense its an anticlimax a futile excuse to put up with her for three hours My jaw begins to clench relax clench relax involuntarily There is music playing somewhere but I cant hear it Evelyn asks the waiter hoarsely if perhaps he could get her some Life Savers from the Korean deli around the block\\n   Then very simply dinner reaches its crisis point when Evelyn says I want a firm commitment\\n   The evening has already deteriorated considerably so this comment doesnt ruin anything or leave me unprepared but the unreasonableness of our situation is choking me and I push my water glass back toward Evelyn and ask the waiter to remove the halfeaten urinal cake My endurance for tonight is shot the second the melting dessert is taken away For the first time I notice that she has been eyeing me for the last two years not with adoration but with something closer to greed Someone finally brings her a water glass along with a bottle of Evian I didnt hear her order\\n   I think Evelyn that I start stall start again that weve lost touch\\n   Why Whats wrong Shes waving to a couple Lawrence Montgomery and Geena Webster I think  and from across the room Geena  holds up her hand which has a bracelet on it Evelyn nods approvingly\\n   My myneedto engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be um corrected I tell her measuring each word carefully But I have no other way to express my blocked needs Im surprised at how emotional this admission makes me and it wears me down I feel lightheaded As usual Evelyn misses theessence of what Im saying and I wonder how long it will take to finally rid myself of her\\n   We need to talk I say quietly\\n   She puts her empty water glass down and stares at me Patrick she begins If youre going to start in again on why I should have breast implants Imleaving she warns\\n   I consider this then Its over Evelyn Its all over\\n   Touchy touchy she says motioning to the waiter for more water\\n   Im serious I say quietly It is fucking over Us This is no joke\\n   She looks back at me and I think that maybesomeoneis actually comprehending what Im trying to get through to them but then she says Lets just avoid the issue all right Im sorry I said anything Now are we having coffee Again she waves the waiter over\\n   Ill have a decaf espresso Evelyn says Patrick\\n   Port I sigh Any kind of port\\n   Would you like to see the waiter begins\\n   Just the most expensive port I cut him off And oh yeah a dry beer\\n   My my Evelyn murmurs after the waiter leaven\\n   Are you still seeing your shrink I ask\\n   Patrick  she warns Who\\n   Sorry I sigh Yourdoctor\\n   No She opens her handbag looking for something\\n   Why not I ask concerned\\n   I told you why she says dismissively\\n   But I dont remember I say mimicking her\\n   At the end of a session he asked me if I could get him plus three into Nells that night She checks her mouth the lips in the mirror of the compact Why do you ask\\n   Because I think you need to see someone I begin hesitantly honestly I think you are emotionally unstable\\n   Youhave a poster of Oliver North in your apartment and youre callingmeunstable she asks searching for something else in the handbag\\n   NoYou are Evelyn I say\\n   Exaggerating Youre exaggerating she says rifling through the bag not looking at me\\n   I sigh but then begin gravely Im not going to push the issue but\\n   How uncharacteristic of you Patrick she says\\n   Evelyn This has got to end I sigh talking to my napkin Im twentyseven I dont want to be weighed down with a commitment\\n   Honey she asks\\n   Dont call me that  I snap\\n   What Honey she asks\\n   Yes I snap again\\n   What do youwantme to call you she asks indignantly CEO She stifles a giggle\\n   Oh Christ\\n   No really Patrick What do you want me to call you\\n   King Im thinking King Evelyn I want you to call me King But I dont say this Evelyn I dont want you to call me anything I dont think we should see each other anymore\\n   But your friends are my friends My friends are your friends I dont think it would work she says and then staring at a spot above my mouth You have a tiny fleck on the top of your lip Use your napkin\\n   Exasperated I brush the fleck away Listen I know that your friends are my friends and vice versa Ive thought about that After a pause I say breathing in You can have them\\n   Finally she looks at me confused and murmurs Youre really serious arent you\\n   Yes I say I am\\n   But what about us What about the past she asks blankly\\n   The past isnt real Its just a dream I say Dont mention the past\\n   She narrows her eyes with suspicion Do you have something against me Patrick And then the hardness in her face changes instantaneously to expectation maybe hope\\n   Evelyn I sigh Im sorry Youre just not terribly important to me\\n   Without missing a beat she demands Wellwhois Who do you thinkis Patrick Who do youwant After an angry pause she asks Cher\\n   Cher I ask back confused CherWhat are you talking about Oh forget it I want it over I need sex on a regular basis I need to be distracted\\n   In a matter of seconds she becomes frantic barely able to contain the rising hysteria thats surging through her body Im not enjoying it as much as I thought I would But what about the past Ourpast she asks again uselessly\\n   Dontmentionit I tell her leaning in\\n   Whynot\\n   Because we never really shared one I say keeping my voice from rising\\n   She calms herself down and ignoring me opening her handbag again mutters Pathological Your behavior is pathological\\n   What doesthatmean I ask offended\\n   Abhorrent Youre pathological She finds a Laura Ashley pillbox and unsnaps it\\n   Pathologicalwhat I ask trying to smile\\n   Forget it She takes a pill that I dont recognize and uses my water to swallow it\\n   ImpathologicalYouretelling me thatImpathological I ask\\n   We look at the world differently Patrick She sniffs\\n   Thank god I say viciously\\n   Youre inhuman she says trying I think not to cry\\n   Im I stall attempting to defend myself  in touch with humanity\\n   No no no She shakes her head\\n   I know my behavior is erratic sometimes I say fumbling\\n   Suddenly desperately she takes my hand from acres the table pulling it closer to her What do you want me to do What is it you want\\n   Oh Evelyn I groan pulling my hand away shocked that Ive finally gotten through to her\\n   Shes crying What do you want me to do Patrick Tell me Please she begs\\n   You should oh god I dont know Wear erotic underwear I say guessing Oh Jesus Evelyn I dont know Nothing You cant do anything\\n   Please what can I do she sobs quietly\\n   Smile less often Know more about cars Say my name with less regularity Is this what you want to hear I ask It wont change anything You dont even drink beer I mutter\\n   But you dont drink beer either\\n   That doesri t matter Besides I just ordered one So there\\n   Oh Patrick\\n   If you really want to do something for me you can stop making a scene right now I say looking uncomfortably around the room\\n   Waiter she asks as soon as he sets down the decaf espresso the port and the dry beer Ill have a Ill have a a what She looks over at me tearfully confused and panicked A Corona Is that what you drink Patrick A Corona\\n   Oh my god Give it up Please just excuse her I tell the waiter then as soon as he walks away Yes A Corona But were in a fucking ChineseCajun bistro so\\n   Oh god Patrick she sobs blowing her nose into the handkerchief Ive tossed at her Youre so lousy Youre inhuman\\n   No Im I stall again\\n   You are not She stops wiping her face unable to finish\\n   Im not what I ask waiting interested\\n   You are not she sniffs looks down her shoulders heaving  all there You  she chokes  dont add up\\n   I do too I say indignantly defending myself I do too add up\\n   Youre a ghoul she sobs\\n   No no I say confused watching her Youre the ghoul\\n   Oh god she moans causing the table next to ours to look over then away I cant believe this\\n   Im leaving now I say soothingly Ive assessed the situation and Im going\\n   Dont she says trying to grab my hand Dont go\\n   Im leaving Evelyn\\n   Where are you going Suddenly she looks remarkably composed Shes been careful not to let the tears which actually Ive just noticed are very few affect her makeup Tell me Patrick where are you going\\n   Ive placed a cigar on the table Shes too upset to even comment Im just leaving I say simply\\n   Butwhere she asks more tears welling up Where are you going\\n   Everyone in the restaurant within a particular aural distance seems to be looking the other way\\n   Where are you going she asks again\\n   I make no comment lost in my own private maze thinking about other things warrants stock offerings ESOPs LBOs IPOs finances

Rolls To Evelyn our relationship is yellow and blue but to me its a gray place most of it blacked out bombed footage from the film in my head is endless shots of stone and any language heard is

me for any identification I suddenly imagine Evelyns skeleton twisted and crumbling and this fills me with glee It takes a long time to answer her question Where are you going but after a sip of the port then the dry beer rousing myself I tell her at the same time wondering If I were an actual automaton what difference would there really be\\n   Libya and then after a significant pause Pago Pago I meant to say Pago Pago and then I add Because of your outburst Im not paying for this meal\\n   Tries to Cook and Eat Girl\\n   Dawn Sometime in November Unable to sleep writhing on my futon still in a suit my head feeling like someone has lit a bonfire on it in it a constant searing pain that keeps both eyes open utterly helpless There are no drugs no food no liquor that can appease the forcefulness of this greedy pain all my muscles are stiff all my nerves burning on fire Im taking Sontinex by the hour since Ive run out of Dalmane but nothing really helps and soon even the box of Sominex is empty Things are lying in the corner of my bedroom a pair of girls shoes from Edward Susan Bennis Allen a hand with the thumb and forefinger missing the new issue ofVanity Fairsplashed with someones blood a cummerbund drenched with gore and from the kitchen wafting into the bedroom is the fresh smell of blood cooking and when I stumble up out of bed into the living room the walls are breathing the stench of decay smothers everything I light a cigar hoping the smoke will mask at least some of it\\n   Her breasts have been chopped off and they look blue and deflated the nipples a disconcerting shade of brown Surrounded by dried black blood they lie rather delicately on a china plate I bought at the Pottery Barn on top of the Wurlitzer jukebox in the corner though I dont remember doing this I have also shaved all the skin and most of the muscle off her face so that it resembles a skull with a long flowing mane of blond hair falling from it which is connected to a full cold corpse its eyes are open the actual eyeballs hanging out of their sockets by their stalks Most of her chest is indistinguishable from her neck which looks like groundup meat her stomach resembles the eggplant and goat cheese lasagna at Il Marlibro or some other kind of dog food the dominant colors red and white and brown A few of her intestines are smeared across one wall and others are mashed up into balls that lie strewn across the glasstop coffee table like long blue snakes mutant worms The patches of skin left on her body are bluegray the color of tinfoil Her vagina has discharged a brownish syrupy fluid that smells like a sick animal as if that rat had been forced back up in there had been digested or something\\n   I spend the next fifteen minutes beside myself pulling out a bluish rope of intestine most of it still connected to the body and shoving it into my mouth choking on it and it feels moist in my mouth and its filled with some kind of paste which smells bad After an hour of digging I detach her spinal cord and decide to Federal Express the thing without cleaning it wrapped in tissue under a different name to Leona Helmsley I want to drink this girls blood as if it were champagne and I plunge my face deep into whats left of her stomach scratching my chomping jaw on a broken rib The huge new television set is on in one of the rooms first blaring outThe Patty Winters Show whose topic today is Human Dairies then a game showWheel of Fortuneand the applause coming from the studio audience sounds like static each time a new letter is turned Im loosening the tie Im still wearing with a bloodsoaked hand breathing in deeply This is my reality Everything outside of this is like some movie I once saw\\n   In the kitchen I try to make meat loaf out of the girl but it becomes too frustrating a task and instead I spend the afternoon smearing her meat all over the walls chewing on strips of skin I ripped from her body then I rest by watching a tape of last weeks new CBS sitcomMurphy BrownAfter that and a large glass of JB Im back in the kitchen The head in the microwave is now completely black and hairless and I place it in a tin pot on the stove in an attempt to boil any remaining flesh I forgot to shave off Heaving the rest of her body into a garbage bag my muscles slathered with BenGay easily handling the dead weight  I decide to use whatever is left of her for a sausage of some kind\\n   A Richard Marx CD plays on the stereo a bag from Zabars loaded with sourdough onion bagels and spices sits on the kitchen table while I grind bone and fat and flesh into patties and though it does sporadically penetrate how unacceptable some of what Im doing actually is I just remind myself that this thing this girl this meat is nothing is shit and along with a Xanax which I am now taking halfhourly this thought momentarily calms me and then Im humming humming the theme to a show I watched often as a childThe Jetsons The Banana Splits Scooby Doo Sigmund and the Sea MonstersIm remembering the song the melody even the key it was sung in but not the show Was itLidsvilleWas itH R Pufnstuf These questions are punctuated by other questions as diverse as Will I ever do time and Did this girl have a trusting heart The smell of meat and blood clouds up the condo until I dont notice it anymore And later my macabre joy sours and Im weeping for myself unable to find solace in any of this crying out sobbing I just want to be loved cursing the earth and everything I have been taught principles distinctions choices morals compromises knowledge unity prayer all of it was wrong without any final purpose All it came down to was die or adapt I imagine my own vacant face the disembodied voice coming from its mouthThese are terrible times Maggots already writhe across the human sausage the drool pouring from my lips dribbles over them and still I cant tell if Im cooking any of this correctly because Im crying too hard and I have never really cooked anything before\\n   Taking an Uzi to the Gym\\n   On a moonless night in the starkness of the locker room at Xclusive after working out for two hours Im feeling good The gun in my locker is an Uzi which cost me seven hundred dollars and though I am also carrying a Ruger Mini  in my Bottega Veneta briefcase and its favored by most hunters I still dont like the way it looks theres something more manly about an Uzi something dramatic about it that gets me excited and sitting here Walkman on my head in a pair of twohundreddollar black Lycra bicycle shorts a Valium just beginning to take effect I stare into the darkness of the locker tempted The rape and subsequent murder last night of an NYU student behind the Gristedes on University Place near her dorm however inappropriate the timing no matter how uncharacteristic the lapse was highly satisfying and though Im unprepared by my change of heart Im in a reflective mood and I place the gun which is a symbol of order to me back in the locker to be used at another time I have videotapes to return money to be taken out of an automated teller a dinner reservation at  Wooster that was difficult to get\\n   Chase Manhattan\\n   Tuesday night at Bouley in No Mans Land a fairly unremarkable marathon dinner even after I tell the table Listen guys my life is a living hell they utterly ignore me the group assembled

gold why longterm bonds are too risky now the spread collar portfolios how to use power effectively new ways to exercise Stolichnaya Cristall how best to impress very important people eternal vigilance life at its best here in Bouley I cannot seem to control myself here in a room that contains a whole host of victims lately I cant help noticing them everywhere in business meetings nightclubs restaurants in passing taxis and in elevators on line at automated tellers and on porno tapes in Davids Cookies and on CNN everywhere all of them having one thing in common they areprey and during dinner I almost become unglued plummeting into a state of near vertigo that forces me to excuse myself before dessert at which point I use the rest room do a line of cocaine pick up my Giorgio Armani wool overcoat and the  magnum barely concealed within it from the coatcheck strap on a holster and then Im outside but onThe Patty Winters Showthis morning there was an interview with a man who set his daughter on fire while she was giving birth at dinner we all had shark\\n   in Tribeca its misty out sky on the verge of rain the restaurants down here empty after midnight the streets remote unreal the only sign of human life someone playing a saxophone on the corner of Duane Street in the doorway of what used to be Duplex which is now an abandoned bistro thatclosed last month a young guy bearded white beret playing a very beautiful but clichd saxophone solo at his feet an open umbrella with a dollar damp and some change in it unable to resist I move up to him listening to the music something fromLes Misrableshe acknowledges my presence nods and while he closes his eyes lifting the instrument up leaning his head back during what I guess he thinks is a passionate moment  in one fluid motion I take the  magnum out of its holster and not wanting to arouse anyone in the vicinity I screw a silencer onto the gun a cold autumn wind rushes up the street engulfing us and when the victim opens his eyes spotting the gun he stops playing the tip of the saxophone still in his mouth I pause too then nod for him to go on and tentatively he does then I raise the gun to his face and in midnote pull the trigger but the silencer doesnt work and in the same instant a huge crimson ring appears behind his head the booming sound of the gunshot deafens me stunned his eyes still alive he falls to his knees then onto his saxophone I pop the clip and replace it with a full one then something bad happens\\n   because while doing this Ive failed to notice the squad car that was traveling behind me  doing what god only knows handing out parking tickets  and after the noise the magnum makes echoes fades the siren of the squad car pierces the night out of nowhere sending my heart into palpitations I start walking away from the trembling body slowly casually at first as if innocent then I break into a run fullfledged the cop car screeching after me over a loudspeaker a cop shouts uselessly halt stop halt put down your weapon ignoring them I make a left on Broadway headingdown toward City Hall Park ducking into an alleyway the squad car follows but only makes it halfway as the alley narrows a spray of blue sparks flying up before it gets stuck and I run out the end of the alley as fast as I can onto Church Street where I flag down a cab hop in the front seat and scream at its driver a young Iranian guy completely taken by surprise to get the hell out of here fast  no drive Im waving the gun at him in his face but he panics cries out in mangled English dont shoot me please dont kill me holding his hands up I mutter oh shit and scream drive but hes terrified oh dont shoot me man dont shoot I impatiently mutter fuck yourself and raising the gun to his face pull the trigger the bullet splatters his head open cracks it in half like a dark red watermelon against the windshield and I reach over him open the door push the corpse out slam the door start driving\\n   in an adrenaline rush causing panting I can only get a few blocks partly because of panic mostly because of the blood brains chunks of head covering the windshield and I barely avoid a collision with another cab on Franklin  is it  and Greenwich veering the taxi sharply to the right swerving into the side of a parked limousine then I shift into reverse screech down the street turn on the windshield wipers realizing too late that the blood sprayed across the glass is on theinside attempt to wipe it away with a gloved hand and racing blindly down Greenwich I lose control entirely the cab swerves into a Korean deli next to a karaoke restaurant called Lotus Blossom Ive been to with Japanese clients the cab rolling over fruit stands smashing through a wall of glass the body of a cashier thudding across the hood Patrick tries to put the cab in reverse but nothing happens he staggers out of the cab leaning against it a nerveracking silence follows nice going Bateman he mutters limping out of the store the body on the hood moaning in agony Patrick with no idea where the cop running toward him across the street has come from hes yelling something into his walkietalkie thinking Patrick is stunned but Patrick surprises him by lunging out before the cop can get to his gun and he knocks him over onto the sidewalk\\n   where people from the Lotus Blossom are now standing staring dumbly at the wreckage no one helping the cop as the two men lie struggling on the sidewalk the cop wheezing from exertion on top of Patrick trying to wrestle the magnum from his grasp but Patrick feels infected like gasoline is coursing through his veins instead of blood it gets windier the temperature drops it starts raining but softly they roll into the street Patrick keeps thinking there should be music he forces a demonic leer his heart thumping and manages quite easily to bring the gun up to the cops face two pairs of hands holding it but Patricks finger pulls the trigger the bullet blowing a crease in the top of the officers skull yet failing to kill him but lowering his aim with the aid of the loosening grip of the officers fingers Patrick shoots him in the face the bullets exit casting a lingering pinkish mist while some of the people on the sidewalk scream do nothing hide run back into the restaurant as the cop car Patrick thought he evaded in the alley careens toward the deli red lights flashing screeching to a halt right when Patrick trips over the curb collapsing onto the sidewalk at the same time reloading the magnum hiding behind the corner the terror he thought had passed engulfing him again thinking I have no idea what Ive done to increase my chances of getting caught I shot a saxophonist asaxophonistwho was probably amimetoo forthatI get this and in the near distance he can hear other cars coming lost in the maze of streets the cops now right here dont bother with warnings anymore they just start shooting and he returns their gunfire from his belly getting a glimpse of both cops behind the open doors of the squad car guns flashing like in a movie and this makes Patrick realize hes involved in an actual gunfight of sorts that hes trying to dodge bullets that the dream threatens to break is gone that hes not aiming carefully just obliviously returning gunfire lying there when a stray bullet sixth in a new round hits the gas tank of the police car the headlights dim before it bursts apart sending a fireball billowing up into the darkness the bulb of a streetlamp above it exploding unexpectedly in a burst of yellowgreen sparks flames washing over the bodies of the policemen both living and dead shattering all the windows of Lotus Blossom Patricks ears ringing\\n   while running toward Wall Street still in Tribeca he stays away from where the streetlamps shine the brightest notices that the entire block hes lurching down is gentrified then he dashes past a row of Porsches tries to open each one and sets a string of car alarm sirens off the car he would like to steal is a black Range Rover with permanent fourwheel drive an aircraftgrade aluminum body on a boxed steel chassis and a fuelinjected V engine but he cant find one and though this disappoints him hes also intoxicated by the whirlwind of confusion by the city itself the rain falling from an icecold sky but still warm enough in the city on the ground for fog to drift through the passageways the skyscrapers create in Battery Park in Wall Street wherever most of them a kaleidoscopic blur and now hes jumping over an embankmentsomersaultingover it then hes running like crazy running full tilt his brain locked into the physical exertion of utter sheer panic helterskelter now he thinks a car is following him down a deserted highway now he feels the night accepts him from somewhere else a shot is heard but doesnt really register because Patricks mind is out of sync forgetting his destination until like a mirage his once building where Pierce Pierce is located comes into view the lights in it going off floor by floor as if a darkness is rising through it running another hundred yards two hundred yards ducking into the stairs below where his senses blocked for the first time with fear and bewilderment and dumbstruck with confusion he rushes into the lobby of what he thinks is his building but no something seems wrong what is ityou movedthe move itself was a nightmare even though Patrick has a better office now the new Barneys and Godiva stores adjacent to the lobby ease the strain and hes gotten the buildings mixed up its only at the elevator\\n   doors both of which are locked where he notices the huge Julian Schnabel in the lobby and he realizeswrong fucking buildingand he whirls around making a mad scramble for the revolving doors but the night watchman who tried to get Patricks attention before now waves him in as hes about to bolt out of the lobby Burning the midnight oil Mr Smith You forgot to sign in and frustrated Patrick shoots at him while spinning once twice through the glass doors which thrust him back into the lobby of god only knows where as the bullet catches the watchman in the throat knocking him backward leaving a spray of blood hanging momentarily in midair before drizzling down on the watchmans contorted twisted face and the black janitor Patrick has just noticed has been watching the scene from a corner of the lobby mop in hand bucket by his feet drops the mop raises his hands and Patrick shoots him right between the eyes a stream of blood covers his face the back of his head explodes in a spray behind him the bullet knocks out a chunk of marble the force of the blast slams him against the wall Patrick dashing across the street toward the light of his new office when he walks in\\n   nodding toward Gus our night watchmansigning in heading up in the elevator higher toward the darkness of his floor calm is eventually restored safe in the anonymity of my new office able with shaking hands to pick up the cordless phone looking through my Rolodex exhausted eyes falling upon Harold Carnes number dialing the seven digits slowly breathing deeply evenly I decide to make public what has been until now my private dementia but Harold isnt in business London I leave a message admitting everything leaving nothing out thirty forty a hundred murders and while Im on the phone with Harolds machine a helicopter with a searchlight appears flying low over the river lightning cracks the sky open in jagged bolts behind it heading toward the building I was last at descending to land on the buildings roof across from this one the bottom of the building surrounded already by police cars two ambulances and a SWAT team leaps out of the helicopter a halfdozen armed men disappear into the entrance on the deck of the roof flares are lined up what seems like everywhere and Im watching all of this with the phone in my hand crouched by my desk sobbing though I dont know why into Harolds machine I left her in a parking lot near a Dunkin Donuts somewhere around midtown and finally after ten minutes of this I sign off by concluding Uh Im a pretty sick guy then hang up but I call back and after an interminable beep proving my message was indeed recorded I leave another Listen its Bateman again and if you get back tomorrow I may show up at Da Umbertos tonight so you know keep your eyes open and the sun a planet on fire gradually rises over Manhattan another sunrise and soon the night turns into day so fast its like some kind of optical illusion\\n   Huey Lewis and the News\\n   Huey Lewis and the News burst out of San Francisco onto the national music scene at the beginning of the decade with their selftitled rock pop album released by Chrysalis though they really didnt come into their own commercially or artistically until their  smashSports Though their roots were visible blues Memphis soul country onHuey Lewis and the News they seemed a little too willing to cash in on the late seventiesearly eighties taste for New Wave and the album though its still a smashing debut  seems a little too stark too punk Examples of this being the drumming on the first single Some of My Lies Are True Sooner or Later and the fake handclaps on Dont Make Me Do It as well as the organ on Taking a Walk Even though it was a little bit strained their peppy boywantsgirl lyrics and the energy with which Lewis as a lead singer instilled all the songs were refreshing Having a great lead guitarist like Chris Hayes who also shares vocals doesnt hurt either Hayes solos are as original and unrehearsed as any in rock Yet the keyboardist Sean Hopper seemed too intent on playing the organ a little too mechanically though his piano playing on the second half of the album gets better and Bill Gibsons drumming was too muted to have much impact The songwriting also didnt mature until much later though many of the catchy songs had hints of longing and regret and dread Stop Trying is just one example\\n   Though the boys hail from San Francisco and they share some similarities with their Southern California counterparts the Beach Boys gorgeous harmonies sophisticated vocalizing beautiful melodies they even posed with a surfboard on the cover of the debut album they also carried with them some of the bleakness and nihilism of the thankfully now forgotten punk rock scene of Los Angeles at the time Talk about your Angry Young Man  listen to Huey on Who Cares Stop Trying Dont Even Tell Me That You Love Me Trouble in Paradise the titles say it all Huey hits his notes like an embittered survivor and the band often sounds as angry as performers like the Clash or Billy Joel or Blondie No one should forget that we have Elvis Costello to thank for discovering Hueyin the first place Huey played harmonica on Costellos second record the thin vapidMy Aim Was You Lewis has some of Costellos supposed bitterness though Huey has a more bitter cynical sense of humor Elvis might think that intellectual wordplay is as important as having a good time and having ones cynicism tempered by good spirits but I wonder what he thinks about Lewis selling so many more records than he\\n   Things looked up for Huey and the boys on the second album sPicture This which yielded two semihits Workin for a Livin  and Do You Believe in Love and the fact that this coincided with the advent of video there was one made for both songs undoubtedly helped sales The sound though still tinged with New Wave trappings seemed more rootsrock than the previous album which might have something to do with the fact that Bob Clearmountain mixed the record or that Huey Lewis and the News took over the producing reins Their songwriting grew more sophisticated and the group wasnt afraid to quietly explore other genres  notably reggae Tell Her a Little Lie and ballads Hope You Love Me Like You Say and Is It Me But for all its powerpop glory the sound and the band seem gratefully less rebellious less angry on this record though the bluecollar bitterness of Workin for a Livin  seems like an outtake from the earlier album They seem more concerned with personal relationships four of the albums ten songs have the word love in their title  rather than strutting around as young nihilists and the mellow goodtimes feel of the record is a surprising infectious change\\n   The band is playing better than it last did and the Tower of Power horns give the record a more open warmer sound The album hits its peak with the backtoback onetwo punch of Workin for a Livin  and Do You Believe in Love which is the best song on the album and is essentially about the singer asking a girl hes met whilelooking for someone to meetif shebelieves in loveThe fact that the song never resolves the question we never find out what the girl says gives it an added complexity that wasnt apparent on the groups debut Also on Do You Believe in Love is a terrific sax solo by Johnny Colla the guy gives Clarence Clemons a run for his money who like Chris Hayes on lead guitar and Sean Hopper on keyboards has by now become an invaluable asset to the band the sax solo on the ballad Is It Me is even stronger Hueys voice sounds more searching less raspy yet plaintive especially on The Only One which is a touching song about what happens to our mentors and where they end up Bill Gibsons drumming is especially vital to this track Though the album should have ended on that powerful note it ends instead with Buzz Buzz Buzz a throwaway blues number that doesnt make much sense compared to what preceded it but in its own joky way it amuses and the Tower of Power horns are in excellent form\\n   There are no such mistakes made on the bands third album and flawless masterpieceSportsChrysalis Every song has the potential to be a huge hit and most of them were It made the band rock n roll icons Gone totally is the badboy image and a new fratguy sweetness takes over they even have the chance to say ass in one song and choose to bleep it instead The whole album has a clear crisp sound and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that gives the songs on the album a big boost And the wacky original videos made to sell the record Heart and Soul The Heart of Rock n Roll If This Is It Bad Is Bad I Want a New Drug made them superstars on MTV\\n   Produced by the bandSportsopens with what will probably become their signature song The Heart of Rock n Roll a loving ode to rock n roll all over the United States Its followed by Heart and Soul their first big single which is a trademark Lewis song though its written by outsiders Michael Chapman and Nicky Chinn and the tune that firmly and forever established them as the premier rock band in the country for the s If the lyrics arent quite up to par with other songs most of them are more than serviceable and the whole thing is a jaunty enterprise about what a mistake onenight stands are a message the earlier rowdier Huey would never have made Bad Is Bad written solely by Lewis is the bluesiest song the band had recorded up to this point and Mario Cipollinas bass playing gets to shine on it but its really Hueys harmonica solos that give it an edge I Want a New Drug with its killer guitar riff courtesy of Chris Hayes is the albums centerpiece not only is it the greatest antidrug song ever written its also a personal statement about how the band has grown up shucked off their badboy image and learned to become more adult Hayes solo on it is incredible and the drum machine used but not credited gives not only I Want a New Drug but most of the album a more consistent backbeat than any of the previous albums  even though Bill Gibson is still a welcome presence\\n   The rest of the album whizzes by flawlessly side two opens with their most searing statement yet Walking on a Thin Line and no one not even Bruce Springsteen has written as devastatingly about the plight of the Vietnam vet in modern society This song though written by outsiders shows a social awareness that was new to the band and proved to anyone who ever doubted it that the band apart from its blues background had a heart And again in Finally Found a Home the band proclaims its newfound sophistication with this paean to growing up And though at the same time its about shedding their rebel image its also about how they found themselves in the passion and energy of rock n roll In fact the song works on so many levels its almost too complex for the album to carry though it never loses its beat and it still has Sean Hoppers ringing keyboards which make it danceable If This Is It is the albums one ballad but its not downbeat Its a plea for a lover to tell another lover if they want to carry on with the relationship and the way Huey sings it arguably the most superb vocal on the album it becomes instilled with hope Again this song  as with the rest of the album  isnt about chasing or longing after girls its about dealing with relationships Crack Me Up is the albums only hint at a throwback to the bands New Wave days and its minor but amusing though its antidrinking antidrug progrowingup statement isnt\\n   And as a lovely ending to an altogether remarkable album the band does a version of Honky Tonk Blues another song written by someone not in the band named Hank Williams and even though its a very different type of song you can feel its presence throughout the rest of the album For all its professional sheen the album has the integrity of honkytonk blues Aside During this period Huey also recorded two songs for the movieBack to the Futurewhich both went Number One The Power of Love and Back in Time delightful extras not footnotes in what has been shaping up into a legendary career What to say toSportsdissenters in the long run Nine million people cant be wrong\\n   ForeChrysalis  is essentially a continuation of theSportsalbum but with an even more professional sheen This is the record where the guys dont need to prove theyve grown up and that theyve accepted rock n roll because in the three year transition betweenSportsandForethey alreadyhadIn fact three of them are wearing suits on the cover of the record It opens with a blaze of fire Jacobs Ladder which is essentially a song about struggle and overcoming compromise a fitting reminder of what Huey and the News represents and with the exception of Hip to Be Square its the best song on the album though it wasnt written by anyone in the band This is followed by the sweetly goodmatured Stuck with You a lightweight paean to relationships and marriage In fact most of the love songs on the album are about sustained relationships unlike the early albums where the concerns were about either lusting after girls and not getting them or getting burned in the process OnForethe songs are about guys who are in control who have the girls and now have to deal with them This new dimension in the News gives the record an added oomph and they seem more content and satisfied less urgent and this makes for their most pleasingly crafted record to date But also for every Doing It All for My Baby a delightful ode about monogamy and satisfaction theres a barnbanning blues scorcher number like Whole Lotta Lovin and side one or on the CD song number five ends with the masterpiece Hip to Be Square which ironically is accompanied by the bands only bad video the key song onForewhich is a rollicking ode to conformity thats so catchy most people probably dont even listen to the lines but with Chris Hayes blasting guitar and the terrific keyboard playing who cares And its not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends its also a personal statement about the band itself though of what Im not quite sure\\n   If the second part ofForedoesnt have the intensity of the first there are some real gems that are actually quite complicated I Know What I Like is a song that Huey would never have sung six years back a blunt declaration of independence  while the carefully placed I Never Walk Alone which follows actually complements the song and explains it in broader terms it also has a great organ solo and except for Hip to Be Square has Hueys strongest vocals Forest for the Trees is an upbeat antisuicide tract and though its title might seem like a clich Huey and the band have a way of energizing clichs and making them originals wholly their own The nifty a cappella Naturally evokes an innocent time while showcasing the bands vocal harmonies if you didnt know better youdthink it was the Beach Boys coming out of your CD player and even if its essentially a throwaway a trifle of sorts the album ends on a majestic note with Simple as That a bluecollar ballad that sounds not a note of resignation but one of hope and its complex message it wasnt written by anyone in the band of survival leads the way to their next albumSmall World where they take on global issuesForemight not be the masterpieceSportsis what could be but in its own way its just as satisfying and the mellower gentler Huey of  is just as happening\\n   Small WorldChrysalis  is the most ambitious artistically satisfying record yet produced by Huey Lewis and the News The Angry Young Man has definitely been replaced by a smoothly professional musician and even though Huey has only really mastered one instrument the harmonica its majestic Dylanesque sounds giveSmall Worlda grandeur few artists have reached Its an obvious transition and their first album that tries to make thematic sense in fact Huey takes on one of the biggest subjects of all the importance of global communication Its no wonder four out of the albums ten songs have the word world in their titles and that for the first time theres not only one butthreeinstrumentals\\n   The CD gets off to a rousing start with the LewisHayespenned Small World Part One which along with its message of harmony has a blistering solo by Hayes at its center In Old Antones one can catch the zydeco influences that the band has picked up on touring around the country and it gives it a Cajun flavor that is utterly unique Bruce Hornsby plays the accordion wonderfully and the lyrics give you a sense of a true Bayou spirit Again on the hit single Perfect World the Tower of Power horns are used to extraordinary effect Its also the best cut on the album written by Alex Call who isnt in the band and it ties up all the albums themes about accepting the imperfections of this world but still learning to keep on dreamin of livin in a perfect world Though the sang is fastpaced pop its still moving in terms of its intentions and the band plays splendidly on it Oddly this is followed by two instrumentals the eerie Africaninfluenced reggae dance track Bobo Tempo and the second part of Small World But just because these tunes are wordless doesnt mean the global message of communication is lost and they dont seem like filler or padding because of the implications of their thematic reprise the band gets to show off its improvisational skills as well\\n   Side two opens smashingly with Walking with the Kid the first Huey song to acknowledge the responsibilities of fatherhood His voice sounds mature and even though we as listeners dont find out until the last line that the kid who we assume is a buddy is actually his son the maturity in Hueys voice tips us off and its hard to believe that the man who once sang Heart and Soul and Some of My Lies Are True is singingthisThe albums big ballad World to Me is a dreamy pearl of a song and though its about sticking together in a relationship it also makes allusions to China and Alaska and Tennessee carrying on the albums Small World theme and the band sounds really good on it Better Be True is also a bit of a ballad but its not a dreamy pearl and its lyrics arent really about sticking together in a relationship nor does it make allusions to China or Alaska and the band sounds really good on it\\n   Give Me the Keys And Ill Drive You Crazy is a goodtimes blues rocker about what else driving around incorporating the albums theme in a much more playful way than previous songs on the album did and though lyrically it might seem impoverished its still a sign that the new serious Lewis that Huey the artist hasnt totally lost his frisky sense of humor The album ends with Slammin which has no words and its just a lot of horns that quite frankly if you turn it up really loud can give you a fucking big headache and maybe even make you feel a little sick though it might sound different on an album or on a cassette though I wouldnt know anything about that Anyway it set off something wicked in me that lasted for days And you cannot dance to it very well\\n   It took something like a hundred people to putSmall Worldtogether counting all the extra musicians drum technicians accountants lawyers who are all thanked but this actually adds to the CDs theme of community and it doesnt clutter the record  it makes it a more joyous experience With this CD and the four previous ones behind it Huey Lewis and the News prove that if this reallyis a small world then these guys are thebestAmerican band of the s on this or any other continent and it has with it Huey Lewis a vocalist musician and writer who just cant be topped\\n   In Bed with Courtney\\n   Im in Courtneys bed Luis is in Atlanta Courtney shivers presses against me relaxes I roll off her onto my back

cocaine he shrugs and says that maybe well be able to find Carnes at Delmonicos But we dont find Carnes at Delmonicos so we head uptown to Smith Wollensky for an eight oclock reservation that one of us made McDermott is wearing a sixbutton doublebreasted wool suit by Cerruti  a tattersall cotton shirt by Louis Boston a silk tie by Dunhill Im wearing a sixbutton doublebreasted wool suit by Ermenegildo Zegna a striped cotton shirt by Luciano Barbera a silk tie by Armani suede wingtips by Ralph Lauren socks by E G Smith Men Whove Been Raped by Women was the topic onThe Patty Winters Showthis morning Sitting in a booth at Smith and Wollensky which is strangely empty Im on Valium drinking a good glass of red wine wondering absently about that cousin of mine at St Albans in Washington who recently raped a girl biting her earlobes off getting a sick thrill not ordering the hash browns how my brother and I once rode horses together played tennis this is burning from my memory but McDermott eclipses these thoughts when he notices I havent ordered the hash browns after dinner has arrived\\n   What is this You cant eat at Smith and Wollensky without ordering the hash browns he complains\\n   I avoid his eyes and touch the cigar Im saving in my jacket pocket\\n   Jesus Bateman youre a raving maniac Been at P P too long he mutters No fucking hash browns\\n   I dont say anything How can I tell McDermott that this is a very disjointed time of my life and that I notice the walls have been painted a bright almost painful white and under the glare of the fluorescent lights they seem to pulse and glow Frank Sinatra is somewhere singing Witchcraft Im staring at the walls listening to the words suddenly thirsty but our waiter is taking orders from a very large table of exclusively Japanese businessmen and someone who I think is either George MacGowan or Taylor Preston in the booth behind this one wearing something by Polo is eyeing me suspiciously and McDermott is still staring at my steak with this stunned look on his face and one of the Japanese businessmen is holding an abacus another one is trying to pronounce the word teriyaki another is mouthing then singing the words to the song and the table laughs an odd not completely foreign sound as he lifts up a pair of chopsticks shaking his head confidently imitating Sinatra His mouth opens what comes out of it is that sry comehitle stale that clazy witchclaft\\n   Something on Television\\n   While getting dressed to meet Jeanette for a new British musical that opened on Broadway last week and then dinner at Progress the new Malcolm Forbes restaurant on the Upper East Side I watch a tape of this morningsPatty Winters Showwhich is split into two parts The first section is a feature on the lead singer of the rock band Guns n Roses Axl Rose whom Patty quoted as telling an interviewer When I get stressed I get violent and take it out on myself Ive pulled razor blades on myself but then realized that having a scar is more detrimental than not having a stereo Id rather kick my stereo in than go punch somebody in the face When I get mad or upset or emotional sometimes Ill walk over and play my piano Part two consists of Patty reading letters that Ted Bundy the mass murderer had written to his fiance during one of his many trials  Dear Carole  she reads while an unfairly bloated head shot of Bundy just weeks away from execution Hashes across the screen  please do not sit in the same row in court with Janet When I look over toward you there she sits contemplating me with her mad eyes like a deranged seagull studying aclam I can feel her spreading hot sauce on me already \\n   I wait for something to happen I sit in my bedroom for close to an hour Nothing does I get up do the rest of the coke a minuscule amount thats in my closet left over from a late Saturday at MK or Au Bar stop at Orso for a drink before meeting Jeanette who I called earlier mentioning that I had two tickets to this particular musical and she didnt say anything except Ill go and I told her to meet me infront of the theater at ten to eight and she hung up I tell myself while Im sitting alone at the bar in Orso that I was going to call one of the numbers that flashed on the bottom of the screen but then I realize that I didnt know what to say and I remember ten of the words Patty read I can feel her spreading hot sauce on me already\\n   I remember these words again for some reason while Jeanette and I are sitting in Progress after the musical and its late the restaurant is crowded We order something called eagle carpaccio mesquitegrilled mahimahi endive with chvre and chocolatecovered almonds this weird kind of gazpacho with raw chicken in it dry beer Right now there really is nothing edible on my plate what there is tastes like plaster Jeanette is wearing a wool smoking jacket a silk chiffon shawl with one sleeve wool tuxedo pants all Armaniantique gold and diamond earrings stockings from Givenchy grosgrain flats She keeps sighing and threatens to light a cigarette even though were seated in the nonsmoking section of the restaurant Jeanettes behavior deeply unsettles me causes black thoughts to form and expand in my head Shesbeen drinking champagne kirs but has already had too many and when she orders her sixth I suggest that maybe shes had enough She looks at me and says I am cold and thirsty and I will order what I fucking want\\n   I say Then have an Evian or San Pellegrino for Christ sakes\\n   Sandstone\\n   My mother and I are sitting in her private room at Sandstone where she is now a permanent resident Heavily sedated she has her sunglasses on and keeps touching her hair and I keep looking at my hands pretty sure that theyre shaking She tries to smile when she asks what I want for Christmas Im not surprised at how much effort it takes to raise my head and look at her Im wearing a twobutton wool gabardine suit with notched lapels by Gian Marco Venturi captoed leather laceups by Armani tie by Polo socks Im not sure where from Its nearing the middle of April\\n   Nothing I say smiling reassuringly\\n   Theres a pause I break it by asking What do you want\\n   She says nothing for a long time and I look back at my hands at dried blood probably from a girl named Suki beneath the thumbnail My mother licks her lips tiredly and says I dont know I just want to have a nice Christmas\\n   I dont say anything Ive spent the last hour studying my hair in the mirror Ive insisted the hospital keep in my mothers room\\n   You look unhappy she says suddenly\\n   Im not I tell her with a brief sigh\\n   You look unhappy she says more quietly this time She touches her hair stark blinding white again\\n   Well you do too I say slowly hoping that she wont say anything else\\n   She doesnt say anything else Im sitting in a chair by the window and through the bars the lawn outside darkens a cloud passes over the sun soon the lawn turns green again She sits on her bed in a nightgown from Bergdorfs and slippers by Norma Kamali that I bought her for Christmas last year\\n   How was the party she asks\\n   Okay I say guessing\\n   How many people were there\\n   Forty Five hundred I shrug Im not sure\\n   She licks her lips again touches her hair once more What time did you leave\\n   I dont remember I answer after a long time\\n   One Two she asks\\n   It must have been one I say almost cutting her off\\n   Oh She pauses again straightens her sunglasses black RayBans I bought her from Bloomingdales that cost two hundred dollars\\n   It wasnt very good I say uselessly looking at her\\n   Why she asks curious\\n   It just wasnt I say looking back at my hand the specks of blood under the nail on my thumb the photograph of my father when he was a much younger man on my mothers bedside table next to a photograph of Sean and me when we were both teenagers wearing tuxedos neither one of us smiling In the photograph of my father hes wearing a sixbutton doublebreasted black sport coat a white spreadcollar cotton shirt a tie pocket square shoes all by Brooks Brothers Hes standing next to one of the topiary animals a long time ago at his fathers estate in Connecticut and theres something the matter with his eyes\\n   The Best City for Business\\n   And on a rainy Tuesday morning after working out at Xclusive I stop by Paul Owens apartment on the Upper East Side One hundred and sixtyone days have passed since I spent the night in it with the two escort girls There has been no word of bodies discovered in any of the citys four newspapers or on the local news no hints of even a rumor floating around Ive gone so far as to ask people dates business acquaintances  over dinners in the halls of Pierce Pierce if anyone has heard about two mutilated prostitutes found in Paul Owens apartment But like in some movie no one has heard anything has any idea of what Im talking about There are other things to worry over the shocking amount of laxative and speed that the cocaine in Manhattan is now being cut with Asia in the s the virtual impossibility of landing an eight oclock reservation at PR the new Tony McManus restaurant on Liberty Island crack So what Im assuming is that essentially like no bodies have been found For all I know Kimball has moved to London too\\n   The building looks different to me as I step out of the taxi though I cant figure out why I still have the keys I stole from Owen the night I killed him and I take them out now to open the lobby door but they dont work wont fit properly Instead a uniformed doorman who wasnt here six months ago opens it for me excusing himself for taking so long I stand there in the rain confused until he ushers me in merrily asking with a thick Irish accent Well are you coming in or staying out youre getting soaked I move into the lobby my umbrella held under one arm tucking the surgical mask I brought with me to deal with the smell back into my pocket Im holding a Walkman debating what to say how to phrase it\\n   Well now what can I do for you sir he asks\\n   I stall a long awkward pause  before saying simply FourteenA\\n   He looks me over carefully before checking his book then beams marking something down Ah of course Mrs Wolfe is up there right now\\n   Mrs Wolfe Weakly I smile\\n   Yes Shes the real estate agent he says looking up at me You do have an appointment dont you\\n   The elevator operator also a new addition stares at the floor as the two of us rise up into the building Im trying to retrace my steps on that night during that whole week uselessly knowing I have never been back to this apartment after murdering the two girlsHow much is Owens apartment worth is a question that keeps forcing its way into my mind until finally it just rests there throbbingThe Patty Winter Showthis morning was about people with half their brains removed My chest feels like ice\\n   The elevator doors open I step out cautiously watching behind me as they close then Im moving down the hallway toward Owens apartment I can hear voices inside I lean against the wall sighing keys in my hand knowing already the locks have been changed As I wonder what I should do trembling staring at my loafers which are black and by A Testoni the door to the apartment opens startling me out of a momentary flash of selfpity A middleaged real estate broker walks out offers a smile asks checking her book Are you my eleven oclock\\n   No I say\\n   She says Excuse me and making her way down the hall looks back at me once with a strange expression on her face before disappearing around the corner Im staring into the apartment A couple in their late twenties stand conferring with each other in the middle of the living room Shes wearing a wool jacket a silk blouse wool flannel slacks Armani vermeil earrings gloves holding a bottle of Evian water He has on a tweed sport jacket cashmere sweater vest cotton chambray shirt tie Paul Stuart Agnes B cotton trench coat draped over arm Behind them the apartment looks spotless New venetian blinds the cowhide paneling is gone however the furniture the mural the glass coffee table Thonet chairs black leather couch all seem intact the largescreen television set has been moved into the living room and its been turned on the volume low a commercial where a stain walks off a jacket and addresses the camera is on now but it doesnt make me forget what I did to Christies breasts to one of the girls heads the nose missing both ears bitten off how you could see her teeth through where I had ripped the flesh from her jaws and both cheeks the torrents of gore and the blood that washed over the apartment the stench of the dead my own confused warning that I had drawn in\\n   Can I help you the real estate agent Mrs Wolfe Im guessing intrudes She has a very angular thin face the nose is large distressinglyreallooking heavily lipsticked mouth whiteblue eyes Shes wearing a wool boucle jacket washed silk blouse shoes earrings a bracelet from where I dont know Maybe shes younger than forty\\n   Im still leaning against the wall staring at the couple who move back into the bedroom leaving the main room empty Im just noticing that bouquets in glass vases dozens of them fill the apartment everywhere and I can smell them from where Im standing in the hall Mrs Wolfe glances behind her to see what Im staring at then back to me Im looking for Doesnt Paul Owen live here\\n   A long pause before she answers No He doesnt\\n   Another long pause Are you like sure I ask before feebly adding I dont understand\\n   She realizes something that causes the muscles in her face to tighten Her eyes narrow but dont close Shes noticed the surgical mask Im gripping in a damp fist and she breathes in sharply refusing to look away I am definitely not feeling right about any of this On the TV in a commercial a man holds up a piece of toast and tells his wife Hey youre right this margarine reallydoestaste better than shit The wife smiles\\n   You saw the ad in theTimes she asks\\n   No I mean yes Yes I did In theTimes I falter gathering a pocket of strength the smell from the roses thick masking something revolting But doesnt Paul Owen stillownthis I ask as forcibly as possible\\n   Theres a long pause before she admits There was no ad in theTimes\\n   We stare at each other endlessly Im convinced she senses Im about to say something Ive seen this look on someones face before Was it in a club A victims expression Had it appeared on a movie screen recently Or had I seen it in the mirror It takes what seems like an hour before I can speak again But thats his  I stop my heart skips resumes beating  furniture I drop my umbrella then lean down quickly to retrieve it\\n   I think you should go she says\\n   I think I want to know what happened I feel sick my chest and back covered with sweat drenched it seems instantaneously\\n   Dont make any trouble she says\\n   All frontiers if there had ever been any seem suddenly detachable and have been removed a feeling that others are creating my fate will not leave me for the rest of the day This is not a game I want to shout but I cant catch my breath though I dont think she can tell I turn my face away I need rest I dont know what to say Confused I reach out for a moment to touch Mrs Wolfes arm to steady myself but I stop it in midair move it to my chest instead but I cant feel it not even when I loosen my tie it rests there trembling and I cant make it stop Im blushing speechless\\n   I suggest you go she says\\n   We stand there in the hallway facing each other\\n   Dont make any trouble she says again quietly\\n   I stand there a few seconds longer before finally backing away holding up my hands a gesture of assurance\\n   Dont come back she says\\n   I wont I say Dont worry\\n   The couple appears in the doorway Mrs Wolfe watches me until Im at the elevator door pressing the button for the attendant In the elevator the smell of the roses is overpowering\\n   Working Out\\n   Free weights and Nautilus equipment relieve stress My body responds to the workout accordingly Shirtless I scrutinize my image in the mirror above the sinks in the locker room at Xclusive My arm muscles burn my stomach is as taut as possible my chest steel pectorals granite hard my eyes white as ice In my locker in the locker room at Xclusive lie three vaginas I recently sliced out of various women Ive attacked in the past week Two are washed off one isnt Theres a barrette clipped to one of them a blue ribbon from Herms tied around my favorite\\n   End of the s\\n   The smell of blood works its way into my dreams which are for the most part terrible on an ocean liner that catches fire witnessing volcanic eruptions in Hawaii the violent deaths of most of the inside traders at Salomon James Robinson doing something bad to me finding myself back at boarding school then at Harvard the dead walk among the living The dreams are an endless reel of car wrecks and disaster footage electric chairs and grisly suicides syringes and mutilated pinup girls flying saucers marble Jacuzzis pink peppercorns When I wake up in a cold sweat I have to turn on the widescreen television to block out the construction sounds that continue throughout the day rising up from somewhere A month ago was the anniversary of Elvis Presleys death Football games flash by the sound turned off I can hear the answering machine click once its volume lowered then twice All summer long Madonna cries out to us life is a mystery everyone must stand alone \\n   When Im moving down Broadway to meet Jean my secretary for brunch in front of Tower Records a college student with a clipboard asks me to name the saddest song I know I tell him without pausing You Cant Always Get What You Want by the Beatles Then he asks me to name the happiest song I know and I say Brilliant Disguise by Bruce Springsteen He nods makes a note and I move on past Lincoln Center An accident has happened An ambulance is parked at the curb A pile of intestines lies on the sidewalk in a pool of blood I buy a very hard apple at a Korean deli which I eat on my way to meet Jean who right now stands at the Sixtyseventh Street entrance to Central Park on a cool sunny day in September When we look up at the clouds she sees an island a puppy dog Alaska a tulip I see but dont tell her a Gucci money clip an ax a woman cut in two a large puffy white puddle of blood that spreads across the sky dripping over the city onto Manhattan\\n   We stop at an outdoor caf Nowheres on the Upper West Side debating which movie to see if there are any museum exhibits we should attend maybe just a walk she suggests the zoo Im nodding mindlessly Jean is looking good like shes been working out and shes wearing a gilt lamb jacket and velvet shorts by Matsuda Im imagining myself on television in a commercial for a new product  wine cooler tanning lotion sugarless gum  and Im moving in jumpcut walling along a beach the film is blackandwhite purposefully scratched eerie vague pop music from the mids accompanies the footage it echoes sounds as if its coming from a calliope Now Im looking into the camera now Im holding up the product  a new mousse tennis shoes  now my hair is windblown then its day then night then day again and then its night\\n   Ill have an iced decaf au lait Jean tells the waiter\\n   Ill have a decapitated coffee also I say absently before catching myself I mean decaffeinated I glance over at Jean worried but she just smiles emptily at me A SundayTimessits on the table between us We discuss plans for dinner tonight maybe Someone who looks like Taylor Preston walks by waves at me I lower my RayBans wave back Someone on a bike pedals past I ask a busboy for water A waiter arrives instead and after that a dish containing two scoops of sorbet cilantrolemon and vodkalime are brought to the table that I didnt hear Jean order\\n   Want a bite she asks\\n   Im on a diet I say But thank you\\n   You dont need to lose any weight she says genuinely surprised Youre kidding right You look great Very fit\\n   You can always be thinner I mumble staring at the traffic in the street distracted by something what I dont know Look better\\n   Well maybe we shouldnt go out to dinner she says concerned I dont want to ruin your willpower\\n   No Its all right I say Im not very good at controlling it anyway\\n   Patrick seriously Ill do whatever you want she says If you dont want to go to dinner we wont I mean\\n   Its okay I stress Something snaps You shouldnt fawn over him I pause before correcting myself I meanme Okay\\n   I just want to know what you want to do she says\\n   To live happily ever after right I say sarcastically Thats whatI want I stare at her hard for maybe half a minute before turning away This quiets her After a while she orders a beer Its hot out on the street\\n   Come on smile she urges sometime later You have no reason to be so sad\\n   I know I sigh relenting But its   tough to smile These days At leastIfind it hard to Im not used to it I guess I dont know\\n   Thats why people need each other she says gently trying to make eye contact while spooning the not inexpensive sorbet into her mouth\\n   Some dont I clear my throat selfconsciously Or well people compensate They adjust After a long pause People can get accustomed to anything right I ask Habit does things to people\\n   Another long pause Confused she says I dont know I guess but one still has to maintain a ratio of more good things than bad in this world she says adding I mean right She looks puzzled as if she finds it strange that this sentence has come out of her mouth A blast of music from a passing cab Madonna againlife is a mystery everyone must stand aloneStartled by the laughter at the table next to ours I cock my head and hear someone admit Sometimes what you wear to the office makes all the difference and then Jean says something and I ask her to repeat it\\n   Havent you ever wanted to make someone happy she asks\\n   What I ask trying to pay attention to her Jean\\n   Shyly she repeats herself Havent you ever wanted to make someone happy\\n   I stare at her a cold distant wave of fright washes over me dousing something I clear my throat again and trying to speak with great purposefulness tell her I was at Sugar Reef the other night that Caribbean place on the Lower East Side you know it\\n   Who were you with she interrupts\\n   Jeanette Evan McGlinn\\n   Oh She nods silently relieved believing me\\n   Anyway I sigh continuing I saw some guy in the mens room a total Wall Street guy wearing a onebutton viscose wool and nylon suit by Luciano Soprani a cotton shirt by Gitman Brothers a silk tie by Ermenegildo Zegna and I mean I recognized the guy a broker named Eldridge Ive seen him at Harrys and Au Bar and DuPlex and Alex Goes to Camp all the places but when I went in after him I saw he was writing something on the wall above the urinal he was standing at I pause take a swallow of her beer When he saw me come in he stopped writing put away the Mont Blanc pen he zipped up his pants said Hello Henderson to me checked his hair in the mirror coughed like he was nervous or something and left the room I pause again another swallow Anyway I went over to use the urinal and I leaned over to read what he wrote Shuddering I slowly wipe my forehead with a napkin\\n   Which was Jean asks cautiously\\n   I close my eyes three words fall from my mouth these lips  Kill All Yuppies \\n   She doesnt say anything\\n   To break the uncomfortable silence that follows I mention all I can come up with which is Did you know that Ted Bundys first dog a collie was named Lassie Pause Had you heard this\\n   Jean looks at her dish as if its confusing her then back up at me Whos Ted Bundy\\n   Forget it I sigh\\n   Listen Patrick We need to talk about something she says Or at leastIneed to talk about something\\n   where there was nature and earth life and water I saw a desert landscape that was unending resembling some sort of crater so devoid of reason and light and spirit that the mind could not grasp it on any sort of conscious level and if you came close the mind would reel backward unable to take it in It was a vision so clear and real and vital to me that in its purity it was almost abstract This was what I could understand this was how I lived my life what I constructed my movement around how I dealt with the tangible This was the geography around which my reality revolved it did not occur to meeverthat people were good or that a man was capable of change or that the world could be a better place through ones taking pleasure in a feeling or a look or a gesture of receiving another persons love or kindness Nothing was affirmative the term generosity of spirit applied to nothing was a clich was some kind of bad joke Sex is mathematics Individuality no longer an issue What does intelligence signify Define reason Desire  meaningless Intellect is not a cure Justice is dead Fear recrimination innocence sympathy guilt waste failure grief were things emotions that no one really felt anymore Reflection is useless the world is senseless Evil is its only permanence God is not alive Love cannot be trusted Surface surface surface was all that anyone found meaning in this was civilization as I saw it colossal and jagged\\n   and I dont remember who it was you were talking to it doesnt matter What does is that you were very forceful yet very sweet and I guess I knew then that She places her spoon down but Im not watching her Im looking out at the taxis moving up Broadway yet they cant stop things from unraveling because Jean says the following A lot of people seem to have She stops continues hesitantly lost touch with life and I dont want to be among them After the waiter clears her dish she adds I dont want to get bruised\\n   I think Im nodding\\n   Ive learned what its like to be alone and I think Im in love with you She says this last part quickly forcing it out\\n   Almost superstitiously I turn toward her sipping an Evian water then without thinking say smiling I love someone else\\n   As if this film had speeded up she laughs immediately looks quickly away down embarrassed Im well sorry gosh\\n   But I add quietly you shouldnt be afraid\\n   She looks back up at me swollen with hope\\n   Something can be done about it I say Then not knowing why Id said that I modify the statement telling her straight onMaybe something cant I dont know Ive thrown away a lot of time to be with you so its not like I dont care\\n   She nods mutely\\n   You should never mistake affection for passion I warn her It can be not good It can    get you into well trouble\\n   Shes not saying anything and I can suddenly sense her sadness flat and calm like a daydream What are you trying to say she asks lamely blushing\\n   Nothing Im just letting you know that appearances can be deceiving\\n   She stares at theTimesstacked in heavy folds on the table A breeze barely causes it to flutter Why are you telling me this\\n   Tactfully almost touching her hand but stopping myself I tell her I just want to avoid any future misconnections A hardbody walks by I notice her then look back at Jean Oh come on dont look that way You have nothing to be ashamed of\\n   Im not she says trying to act casual I just want to know if youre disappointed in me for admitting this\\n   How could she ever understand that there isnt any way I could be disappointed since I no longer find anything worth looking forward to\\n   You dont know much about me do you I ask teasingly\\n   I know enough she says her initial response but then she shakes her head Oh lets just drop this I made a mistake Im sorry In the next instant she changes her mind I want to know more she says gravely\\n   I consider this before asking Are you sure\\n   Patrick she says breathlessly I know my life would be much emptier without you in it\\n   I consider this too nodding thoughtfully\\n   And I just cant She stops frustrated I cant pretend these feelings dont exist can I\\n   Shhh\\n   there is an idea of a Patrick Bateman some kind of abstraction but there is no real me only an entity something illusory and though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparableI simply am not there It is hard for me to make sense on any given level Myself is fabricated an aberration I am a noncontingent human being My personality is sketchy and unformed my heartlessness goes deep and is persistent My conscience my pity my hopes disappeared a long time ago probably at Harvard if they ever did exist There are no more barriers to cross All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane the vicious and the evil all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed I still though hold on to one single bleak truth no one is safe nothing is redeemed Yet I am blameless Each model of human behavior must be assumed to have some validity Is evil something you are Or is it something you do My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone In fact I want my pain to be inflicted on others I want no one to escape But even after admitting this and I have countless times in just about every act Ive committed  and coming facetoface with these truths there is no catharsis I gain no deeper knowledge about myself no new understanding can be extracted from my telling There has been no reason for me to tell you any of this Thisconfession has meantnothing\\n   Im asking Jean How many people in this world are like me\\n   She pauses carefully answers I dont think anyone Shes guessing\\n   Let me rephrase the ques Wait how does my hair look I ask interrupting myself\\n   Uh fine\\n   Okay Let me rephrase the question I take a sip of her dry beer OkayWhydo you like me I ask\\n   She asks backWhy\\n   Yes I say Why\\n   Well A drop of beer has fallen onto my Polo shirt She hands me her napkin A practical gesture that touches me Youre concerned with others she says tentatively Thats a very rare thing in what  she stops again  is a I guess a hedonistic world This is Patrick youre embarrassing me She shakes her head closing her eyes\\n   Go on I urge Please I want to know\\n   Youre sweet She rolls her eyes up Sweetness is sexy I dont know But so ismystery Silence And I think mystery youre mysterious Silence followed by a sigh And youre considerate She realizes something no longer scared stares at me straight on And I think shy men are romantic\\n   How many people in this world are like me I ask again Do I really appear like that\\n   Patrick she says I wouldnt lie\\n   No of course you wouldnt but I think that My turn to sigh contemplatively I think you know how they say no two snowflakes are ever alike\\n   She nods\\n   Well I dont think thats true I think a lot of snowflakes are alike and I think a lot of people are alike too\\n   She nods again though I can tell shes very confused\\n   Appearancescanbe deceiving I admit carefully\\n   No she says shaking her head sure of herself for the first time I dont think they are deceiving Theyre not\\n   Sometimes Jean I explain the lines separating appearance what you see  and reality  what you dont  become well blurred\\n   Thats not true she insists Thats simply not true\\n   Really I ask smiling\\n   I didnt use to think so she says Maybe ten years ago I didnt But I do now\\n   What do you mean I ask interested Youused to\\n   a flood of reality I get an odd feeling that this is a crucial moment in my life and Im startled by the suddenness of what I guess passes for an epiphany There is nothing of value I can offer her For the first time I see Jean as uninhibited she seems stronger less controllable wanting to take me into a new and unfamiliar land  the dreaded uncertainty of a totally different world I sense she wants to rearrange my life in a significant way  her eyes tell me this and though I see truth in them I also know that one day sometime very soon she too will be locked in the rhythm ofmy insanity All I have to do is keep silent about this and not bring it up  yet she weakens me its almost as if shes making the decision about who I am and in my own stubborn willful way I can admit to feeling a pang something tightening inside and before I can stop it I find myself almost dazzled and moved that I might have the capacity to accept though not return her love I wonder if even now right here in Nowheres she can see the darkening clouds behind my eyes lifting And though the coldness I have always felt leaves me the numbness doesnt and probably never will This relationship will probably lead to nothing this didnt change anything I imagine her smelling clean like tea\\n   Patrick talk to me dont be so upset she is saying I think its time for me to take a good look at the world Ive created I choke tearfully finding myself admitting to her I came upon a half gram of cocaine in my armoire last night Im squeezing my hands together forming one large fist all knuckles white\\n   What did you do with it she asks\\n   I place one hand on the table She takes it\\n   I threw it away I threw it all away I wanted todoit I gasp but I threw it away\\n   She squeezes my hand tightly Patrick she asks moving her hand up until its gripping my elbow When I find the strength to look back at her it strikes me how useless boring physically beautiful she really is and the questionWhy not end up with herfloats into my line of vision An answer she has a better body than most other girls I know Another one everyone is interchangeable anyway One more it doesnt really matter She sits before me sullen but hopeful characterless about to dissolve into tears I squeeze her hand back moved no touched by her ignorance of evil She has one more test to pass\\n   Do you own a briefcase I ask her swallowing\\n   No she says I dont\\n   Evelyn carries a briefcase I mention\\n   She does  Jean asks\\n   And what about a Filofax\\n   A small one she admits\\n   Designer I ask suspiciously\\n   No\\n   I sigh then take her hand small and hard in mine \\n   and in the southern deserts of Sudan the heat rises in airless waves thousands upon thousands of men women children roam throughout the vast bushland desperately seeking food Ravaged and starving leaving a trail of dead emaciated bodies they eat weeds and leaves and lily pads stumbling from village to village dying slowly inexorably a gray morning in the miserable desert grit flies through the sir a child with a face like a black moon lies in the sand scratching at his throat cones of dust rising flying across land like whirling tops no one can see the sun the child is covered with sand almost dead eyes unblinking grateful stop and imagine for an instant a world where someone is grateful for something none of the haggard pay attention as they file by dazed and in pain nothere is one who pays attention who notices the boys agony and smiles as if holding a secret the boy opens and closes his cracked chapped mouth soundlessly there is a school bus in the distance somewhere and somewhere else above that in space a spirit rises a door opens it asks Why a home for the dead an infinity it hangs in a void time limps by love and sadness rush through the boy\\n   Okay\\n   I am dimly aware of a phone ringing somewhere In the caf on Columbus countless numbers hundreds of people maybe thousands have walked by our table during my silence Patrick Jean says Someone with a baby stroller stops at the corner and purchases a Dove Bar The baby stares at Jean and me We stare back Its really weird and Im experiencing a spontaneous kind of internal sensation I feel Im moving toward as well as away from something and anything is possible\\n   Aspen\\n   It is four days before Christmas at two in the afternoon Im sitting in the back of a pitchblack limousine parked in front of a nondescript brownstone off Fifth Avenue trying to read an article about Donald Trump in the new issue ofFamemagazine Jeanette wants me to come in with her but I say Forget it She has a black eye from last night since I had to coerce her over dinner at Il Marlibro to even consider doing this then after a more forceful discussion at my apartment she consented Jeanettes dilemma lies outside my definition of guilt and I had told her truthfully over dinner that it was very hard for me to express concern for her that I dont feel During the entire drive from my place on the Upper West Side shes been sobbing The only clear identifiable emotion coming from her is desperation and maybe longing and though I successfully ignore her for most of the ride I finally have to tell her Listen Ive already taken two Xanax this morning so uh youre incapable of like upsetting me Now as she stumbles out of the limo onto the frozen pavement I mumble Its for the best and offering consolation Dont take it so seriously The driver whose name Ive forgotten leads her into the brownstone and she gives a last regretful look back I sigh and wave her off Shes still wearing from last night a leopardprint cotton balmacaan coat with wool challis lining over a wool crepe shirtless dress by Bill Bless Bigfoot was interviewed onThe Patty Winters Show this morning and to my shock I found him surprisingly articulate and charming The glass Im drinking Absolut vodka from is Finnish Im very suntanned compared to Jeanette\\n   The driver comes out of the building gives me thumbsup carefully pulls the limousine away from the curb and begins the trek to JFK airport where my flight to Aspen leaves in ninety minutes When I get back in January Jeanette will be out of the country I relight a cigar search for an ashtray Theres a church on the corner of this street Who cares This is I think the fifth child Ive had aborted the third I havent aborted myself a useless statistic I admit The wind outside the limousine is brisk and cold and the rain hits the darkened windows in rhythmic waves mimicking Jeanettes probable weeping in the operating room dizzy from the anesthesia thinking about a memory from her past a moment where the world was perfect I resist the impulse to start cackling hysterically\\n   At the airport I instruct the chauffeur to stop by FAO Schwarz before picking Jeanette up and purchase the following a doll a rattle a teething ring a white Gund polar bear and have them sitting in the backseat for her unwrapped Jeanette should be okay she has her whole life in front of her that is if she doesnt run into me Besides this girls favorite movie isPretty in Pinkand she thinks Sting is cool so what is happening to her is like not totally undeserved and one shouldnt feel bad for her This is no time for the innocent\\n   Valentines Day\\n   Tuesday morning and Im standing by my desk in the living room on the phone with my lawyer alternately keeping my eye onThe Patty Winters Showand the maid as she waxes the floor wipes blood smears off the walls throws away goresoaked newspapers without a word Faintly it hits me that she too is lost in a world of shit completely drowning in it and this somehow sets off my remembering that the piano tuner will be stopping by this afternoon and that I should leave a note with the doorman to let him in Not that the Yamaha has ever been played its just that one of the girls fell against it and some strings which I used later were pulled out snapped or something Into the phone Im saying I need more tax breaks Patty Winters is on the TV screen asking a child eight or nine But isnt that just another term for an orgy The timer buzzes on the microwave Im heating up a souffl\\n   Theres no use in denying it this has been a bad week Ive started drinking my own urine I laugh spontaneously at nothing Sometimes I sleep under my futon Im flossing my teeth constantly until my gums are aching and my mouth tastes like blood Before dinner last night at  with Reed Goodrich and Jason Rust I was almost caught at a Federal Express in Times Square trying to send the mother of one of the girls I killed last week what might be a driedup brown heart And to Evelyn I successfully Federal Expressed through the office a small box of flies along with a note typed by Jean saying that I nevereverwanted to see her face again and though she doesnt really need one to go on a fucking diet But there are also things that the average person would think are nice that Ive done to celebrate the holiday items Ive bought Jean and had delivered to her apartment this morning Castellini cotton napkins from Bendels a wicker chair from Jenny B Goode a taffeta table throw from Barneys a vintage chainmailvent purse and a vintage sterling silver dresser set from Macys a white pine whatnot from Conrans an Edwardian ninecaratgold gate bracelet from Bergdorfs and hundreds upon hundreds of pink and white roses\\n   The office Lyrics to Madonna songs keep intruding bursting into my head announcing themselves in tiring familiar ways and I stare into space my eyes lazily lit up while I try to forget about the day looming before me but then a phrase that fills me with a nameless dread keeps interrupting the Madonna songsisolated farmhouseconstantly returns to me over and over Someone Ive been avoiding for the last year a nerd fromFortunewho wants to write an article about me calls again this morning and I end up calling the reporter back to arrange an interview Craig McDermott is having some kind of fax frenzy and wont take any of my phone calls preferring to communicate by fax only ThePostthis morning says the remains of three bodies that disappeared aboard a yacht last March have been recovered frozen in ice hacked up and bloated in the East River some maniac is going around the city poisoning oneliter bottles of Evian water seventeen dead already talk of zombies the public mood increasing randomness vast chasms of misunderstanding\\n   And for the sake of form Tim Price resurfaces or at least Im pretty sure he does While Im at my desk simultaneously crossing out the days in my calendar that have already passed and reading a new best seller about once management calledWhy It Works to Be a Jerk Jean buzzes in announcing that Tim Price wants to talk and fearfully I say Send him in Price strolls into the office wearing a wool suit by Canali Milano a cotton shirt by Ike Behar a silk tie by Bill Bless captoed leather laceups from Brooks Brothers Im pretending to be on the phone He sits down across from me on the other side of the Palazzetti glasstop desk Theres a smudge on his forehead or at least thats what I think I see Aside from that he looks remarkably fit Our conversation probably resembles something like this but is actually briefer\\n   Price I say shaking his hand Where have you been\\n   Oh just making the rounds He smiles But hey Im back\\n   Far out I shrug confused How was it\\n   It wassurprising He shrugs too It was depressing\\n   I thought I saw you in Aspen I murmur\\n   Hey how are you Bateman he asks\\n   Im okay I tell him swallowing Just existing\\n   And Evelyn he asks How is she\\n   Well we broke up I smile\\n   Thats too bad He takes this in remembers something Courtney\\n   She married Luis\\n   Grassgreen\\n   No Carruthers\\n   He takes this in too Do you have her number\\n   While writing it down for him I mention Youve been gone like forever Tim Whats the story I ask again noticing the smudge on his forehead though I get the feeling that if I asked someone else if it was truly there he or she would just say no\\n   He stands up takes the card Ive been back You just probably missed me Lost track Because of the move He pauses teasingly Im working for Robinson Righthand man you know\\n   Almond I ask offering one a futile effort on my part to mask my dismay at his smugness\\n   He pats my back says Youre a madman Batsman An animal A total animal\\n   I cant disagree I laugh weakly walking him to the door As he leaves Im wondering and not wondering what happens in the world of Tim Price which is really the world of most of us big ideas guy stuff boy meets the world boy gets it\\n   Bum on Fifth\\n   Im coming back from Central Park where near the childrens zoo close to the spot I murdered the McCaffrey boy I fed portions of Ursulas brain to passing dogs Walking down Fifth Avenue around four oclock in the afternoon everyone on the street looks sad the air is full of decay bodies lie on the cold pavement miles of it some are moving most are not History is sinking and only a very few seem dimly aware that things are getting bad Airplanes fly low across the city crossing in front of the sun Winds shoot up Fifth then funnel down Fiftyseventh Street Flocks of pigeons rise in slow motion and burst up against the sky The smell of burning chestnuts mixes with carbon monoxide fumes I notice the skyline has changed only recently I look up admiringly at Trump Tower tall proudly gleaming in the late afternoon sunlight In front of it two smartass nigger teenagers are ripping off tourists at threecard monte and I have to fight the impulse to blow them away\\n   A bum I blinded one spring sits crosslegged on a ratty blanket near the corner of Fiftyfifth Street Moving closer I see the beggars scarred face and then the sign hes holding beneath it which reads VIETNAM VET BLINDED IN VIETNAM PLEASE HELP ME WE ARE HUNGRY AND HOMELESS We Then I notice the dog who is already eyeing me suspiciously and as I approach its master gets up growling and when Im standing over the bum it finally barks wagging its tail frantically I kneel down threateningly raise a hand at it The dog backs off its paws askew\\n   Ive pulled out my wallet pretending to drop a dollar into his empty coffee can but then realize Why bother pretending No ones watching anyway definitely nothim I retract the dollar leaning in He senses my presence and stops shaking the can The sunglasses he wears dont even begin to cover the wounds I inflicted His nose is so junked up I cant imagine a person breathing through it\\n   You never were in Vietnam I whisper in his ear\\n   After a silence during which he pisses in his pants the dog whimpering he croaks Please dont hurt me\\n   Why would I waste my time I mutter disgusted\\n   I move away from the bum noticing instead a little girl smoking a cigarette begging for change outside Trump Tower Shoo I say She says Shoo back OnThe Patty Winters Showthis morning a Cheerio sat in a very small chair and was interviewed for close to an hour Later this afternoon a woman wearing a silver fox and mink coat has her face slashed in front of the Stanhope by an enraged fur activist But now still staring at the sightless bum from across the street I buy a Dove Bar a coconut one in which I find part of a bone\\n   New Club\\n   Thursday night I run into Harold Carnes at a party for a new club called Worlds End that opens in a space where Pettys used to be on the Upper East Side Im with Nina Goodrich and Jean in a booth and Harolds standing at the bar drinking champagne Im drunk enough to finally confront him about the message I left on his machine Excused from the booth I make my way to the other side of the bar realizing that I need a martini to fortify myself before discussing this with Cannes it has been averyunstable week for me I found myself sobbing during an episode ofAlfon Monday Nervously I approach Harold is wearing a wool suit by Gieves Hawkes a silk twill tie cotton shirt shoes by Paul Stuart he looks heavier than I remember Face it hes telling Truman Drake the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the s\\n   Relieved that Harold is as usual still dispensing valuable andnewinformation with the addition of a faint but unmistakable trace of god forbid an English accent I find myself brazen enough to blurt out Shut up Carnes they willnot I down the martini Stoli while Cannes looking quite taken aback stricken almost turns around to face me and his bloated head breaks out into an uncertain smile Someone behind us is saying But look what happened to Gekko\\n   Truman Drake pats Harold on the back and asks me Is there one suspender width thats more well appropriate than others Irritably I push dim into the crowd and he disappears\\n   So Harold I say did you get my message\\n   Carnes seems confused at first and while lighting a cigarette finally laughs Jesus Davis Yes that was hilarious Thatwasyou was it\\n   Yes naturally Im blinking muttering to myself really waving his cigarette smoke away from my face\\n   Bateman killing Owen and the escort girl He keeps chuckling Oh thats bloody marvelous Really key as they say at the Groucho Club Really key Then looking dismayed he adds It was a rather long message no\\n   Im smiling idiotically and then I say But what exactly do you mean Harold Secretly thinking to myself that this fat bastard couldnt possibly have gotten into the fucking Groucho Club and even if he had to admit it in such a fashion obliterates the fact that his entrance was accepted\\n   Why the message you left Carnes is already looking around the club waving to various people and bimbos By the way Davis how is Cynthia He accepts a glass of champagne from a passing waiter Youre still seeing her right\\n   But wait Harold Whatdoyoumean I repeat emphatically\\n   Hes already bored neither concerned nor listening and excusing himself says Nothing Good to see you Oh my is that Edward Towers\\n   I crane my neck to look then turn back to Harold No I say CarnesWait\\n   Davis he sighs as if patiently trying to explain something to a child I am not one to badmouth anyone your joke was amusing But come on man you had one fatal flaw Batemans such a bloody asskisser such a brownnosing goodygoody that I couldnt fully appreciate it Otherwise it was amusing Now lets have lunch or well have dinner at  Wooster or something with McDermott or Preston A real raver He tries to move on\\n   Rayvah Rayvah Did you sayrayvah Carnes Im wideeyed feeling wired even though I havent done any drugs What are you talkingabout Bateman iswhat\\n   Oh good god man Why else would Evelyn Richards dump him You know really He could barely pick upan escort girl let alone what was it you said he did to her Harold is still looking distractedly around the club and he waves to another couple raising his champagne glass Oh yes chop her up  He starts laughing again though this time it sounds polite Now if youll excuse me I must really\\n   Wait Stop I shout looking up into Carnes face making sure hes listening You dont seem to understand Youre not really comprehending any of this Ikilled himI did it CarnesI chopped Owens fucking head offI tortured dozens of girls That whole message I left on your machine wastrue Im drained not appearing calm wondering why this doesnt feel like a blessing to me\\n   Excuse me he says trying to ignore my outburst I reallymust be going\\n   No I shout Now Carnes Listen to me Listen very very carefully IkilledPaulOwenandIlikedit I cant make myself any clearer My stress causes me to choke on the words\\n   But thats simply not possible he says brushing me off And Im not finding this amusing anymore\\n   It never was supposed to be I bellow and then Why isnt it possible\\n   Its just not he says eyeing me worriedly\\n   Why not I shout again over the music though theres really no need to adding You stupid bastard\\n   He stares at me as if we are both underwater and shouts back very clearly over the din of the club Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in Londonjust ten days ago\\n   After we stare at each other for what seems like a minute I finally have the nerve to say something back to him but my voice lacks any authority and Im not sure if I believe myself when I tell him simply No you didnt But it comes out a question not a statement\\n   Now Donaldson Carnes says removing my hand from his arm If youll excuse me\\n   Oh youre excused I sneer Then I make my way back to our booth where John Edmonton and Peter Beavers are now sitting and I numb myself with a Halcion before taking Jean home back to my place Jean is wearing something by Oscar de la Renta Nina Goodrich was wearing a sequined dress by Matsuda and refused to give me her number even though Jean was in the womens room downstairs\\n   Taxi Driver\\n   Another broken scene in what passes for my life occurs on Wednesday seemingly pointing to someones fault though whose I cant be sure Stuck in gridlock in a cab heading downtown toward Wall Street after a power breakfast at the Regency with Peter Russell who used to be my dealer before he got a real job and Eddie Lambert Russell was wearing a twobutton wool sport coat by Redaelli a cotton shirt by Hackert a silk tie by Richel pleated wool trousers by Krizia Uomo and leather ColeHaan shoesThe Patty Winters Showthis morning was about girls in the fourth grade who trade sex for crack and I almost canceled with Lambert and Russell to catch it Russell ordered for me while I was in the lobby on the phone It was unfortunately a highfat highsodium breakfast and before I could comprehend what was happening plates of herbed waffles with ham in Madeira cream sauce grilled sausages and sour cream coffee cake were set at our table and I had to ask the waiter for a pot of decaf herbal tea a plate of sliced mango with blueberries and a bottle of Evian In the early morning light that poured through the windows at the Regency I watched as our waiter shaved black truffles gracefully over Lamberts steaming eggs Overcome I broke down and demanded to have the black truffles shaved over my mango slices Nothing much happened during the breakfast I had to make another phone call and when I returned to our table I noticed that a mango slice was missing but I didnt accuse anyone I had other things on my mind how to help Americas schools the trust gap desk sets a new era of possibilities and whats in it for me getting tickets to see Sting inThe Threepenny Operawhich just opened on Broadway how to take more and remember less\\n   In the cab Im wearing a doublebreasted cashmere and wool overcoat by Studio  from Ferr a wool suit with pleated trousers by DeRigueur from Schoeneman a silk tie by Givenchy Gentleman socks by Interwoven shoes by Armani reading theWall Street Journalwith my RayBan sunglasses on and listening to a Walkman with a Bix Beiderbecke tape playing in it I put down theJournalpick up thePost just to check Page Six At the light on Seventh and Thirtyfourth in the cab next to this one sits I think Kevin Gladwin wearing a suit by Ralph Lauren I lower my sunglasses Kevin looks up from the new issue ofMoneymagazine and spots me looking over at him in a curious way before his cab moves forward in the traffic The cab Im in suddenly breaks free of the gridlock and turns right on Twentyseventh taking the West Side Highway down to Wall Street I put the paper down concentrate on the music and the weather how unseasonably cool it is and Im just beginning to notice the way the cabdriver looks at me in the rearview mirror A suspicious hungry expression keeps changing the features on his face a mass of clogged pores ingrown hairs I sigh expecting this ignoring him Open the hood of a car and it will tell you something about the people who designed it is just one of many phrases Im tortured by\\n   But the driver knocks on the plexiglass divider motions to me While taking the Walkman off I notice hes locked all the doors I see the locks lower in a flash hear the hollow clicking noise the moment I turn the volume off The cab is speeding faster than it should down the highway in the far right lane Yes I ask irritably What\\n   Hey dont I know you he asks in a thick barely penetrable accent that could easily be either New Jersey or Mediterranean\\n   No I start putting the Walkman back on\\n   You look familiar he says Whats your name\\n   No I dont You dont either I say then an afterthought Chris Hagen\\n   Come on Hes smiling like theres something wrong I know who you are\\n   Im in a movie Im an actor I tell him A model\\n   Nah thats not it he says grimly\\n   Well I lean over checking his name  Abdullah do you have a membership at MK\\n   He doesnt answer I reopen thePost to a photo of the mayor dressed as a pineapple then close it again and rewind the tape in my Walkman I start counting to myself one two three four  my eyes focus in on the meter Why didnt I carry a gun with me this morning Because I didnt think I had to The only weapon on me is a used knife from last night\\n   No he says again Ive seen your face somewhere\\n   Finally exasperated I ask trying to appear casual You haveReally Interesting Just watch the road Abdullah\\n   Theres a long scary pause while he stares at me in the rearview mirror and the grim smile fades His face is blank He says I know Man I know who you are and hes nodding his mouth drawn tight The radio that was tuned into the news is shut off\\n   Buildings pass by in a grayred blur the cab passes other cabs the sky changes color from blue to purple to black back to blue At another light a red one he races straight through  we pass on the other side of the West Side Highway a new DAgostinos on the corner where Mars used to be and it moves me to tears almost because its something thats identifiable and I get as nostalgic for the market even though its not one I willever shop at as I have about anything and I almost interrupt the driver tell him to pull over have him let me out let him keep the change from a ten  no a twenty  but I cant move because hes driving too fast and something intervenes something unthinkable and ludicrous and I hear him say it maybe Youre the guy who kill Solly His face is locked into a determined grimace As with everything else the following happens very quickly though it feels like an endurance test\\n   I swallow lower my sunglasses and tell him to slow down before asking Who may I ask is Sally\\n   Man your face is on a wanted poster downtown he says unflinching\\n   I think I would like to stop here I manage to croak out\\n   Youre the guy right Hes looking at me like Im some kind of viper\\n   Another cab its light on empty cruises past ours going at least eighty Im not saying anything just shaking my head I am going to take I swallow trembling open my leather datebook pull out a Mount Blanc pen from my Bottega Veneta briefcase  your license number down  \\n   You kill Solly he says definitely recognizing me from somewhere cutting another denial on my part by growling You sonofabitch\\n   Near the docks downtown he swerves off the highway and races the cab toward the end of a deserted parking area and it hits me somewhere now this moment when he drives into and then over a dilapidated rustcovered aluminum fence heading toward water that all I have to do is put the Walkman on blot out the sound of the cabdriver but my hands are twisted into paralyzed fists that I cant unclench held captive in the cab as it hurtles toward a destination only the cabdriver who is obviously deranged knows The windows are rolled down partially and I can feel the cool morning air drying the mousse on my scalp I feel naked suddenly tiny My mouth tastes metallic then it gets worse My vision a winter road But Im left with one comforting thought I am rich millions are not\\n   Youve like incorrectly identified me Im saying\\n   He stops the cab and turns around toward the backseat Hes holding a gun the make of which I dont recognize Im staring at him my quizzical expression changing into something else\\n   The watch The Rolex he says simply\\n   I listen silent squirming in my seat\\n   He repeats Thewatch\\n   Is this some kind of prank I ask\\n   Get out he spits Get the fuck out of the car\\n   I stare past the drivers head out the windshield at gulls flying low over the dark wavy water and opening the door I step out of the cab cautiously no sudden moves Its a cold day My breath steams wind picks it up swirls it around\\n   The watch you scumbag he says leaning out the window the gun aimed at my head\\n   Listen I dont know what you think youre doing or what youre exactly trying to accomplish or what it is you thinkyoure going to be able to do Ive never been fingerprinted I have alibis\\n   Shut up Abdullah growls cutting me off Just shut your fucking mouth\\n   I am innocent I shout with utter conviction\\n   The watch He cocks the gun\\n   I unhook the Rolex and sliding it off my wrist hand it to him\\n   Wallet He motions with his gun Just the cash\\n   Helplessly I take out my new gazelleskin wallet and quickly my fingers freezing numb hand him the cash which amounts to only three hundred dollars since I didnt have time to stop at an automated teller before the power breakfast Solly Im guessing was the cabdriver I killed during the chase scene last fall even though that guy was Armenian I suppose I could have killed another one and I am just not recalling this particular incident\\n   What are you going to do I ask Isnt there a reward of some kind\\n   No No reward he mutters shuffling the bills with one hand the gun still pointed at me in the other\\n   How do you know Im not going to call you in and get your license revoked I ask handing over a knife I just found in my pocket that looks as if it was dipped into a bowl of blood and hair\\n   Because youre guilty he says and then Get that away from me waving the gun at the stained knife\\n   Likeyou know I mutter angrily\\n   The sunglasses He points again with the gun\\n   How do you know Im guilty I cant believe Im asking this patiently\\n   Look what youre doing asshole he says The sunglasses\\n   These are expensive I protest then sigh realizing the mistake I mean cheap Theyre very cheap Just Isnt the money enough\\n   The sunglasses Give them now he grunts\\n   I take the Wayfarers off and hand them to him Maybe I really did kill a Solly though Im positive that any cabdrivers Ive killed lately werenot American I probably did There probably is a wanted poster of me at where the taxi  the place where all the taxis congregate Whats it called The driver tries the sunglasses on looks at himself in the rearview mirror and then takes them off He folds the glasses and puts them in his jacket pocket\\n   Youre a dead man I smile grimly at him\\n   And youre a yuppie scumbag he says\\n   Youre a dead man Abdullah I repeat no joke Count on it\\n   Yeah And youre a yuppie scumbag Which is worse\\n   He starts the cab up and pulls away from me\\n   While walking back to the highway I stop choke back a sob my throat tightens I just want to Facing the skyline through all the baby talk I murmur keep the game going As I stand frozen in position an old woman emerges behind aThreepenny Opera poster at a deserted bus stop and shes homeless and begging hobbling over her face covered with sores that look like bugs holding out a shaking red hand Oh will you please go away I sigh She tells me to get a haircut\\n   At Harrys\\n   On a Friday evening a group of us have left the office early finding ourselves

Does being a Libra signify anything and if so can you prove it Today I was obsessed with the idea of faxing Sarahs blood I drained from her vagina over to her office in the mergers division at Chase Manhattan and I didnt work out this morning because Id made a necklace from the bones of some girls vertebrae and wanted to stay home and wear it around my neck while I masturbated in the white marble tub in my bathroom grunting and moaning like some kind of animal Then I watched a movie about five lesbians and ten vibrators Favorite group Talking Heads Drink JB or Absolut on the rocks TV showLate Night with David LettermanSoda Diet Pepsi Water Evian Sport Baseball\\n   The conversation follows its own rolling accord no real structure or topic or internal logic or feeling except of course for its own hidden conspiratorial one Just words and like in a movie but one that has been transcribed improperly most of it overlaps Im having a sort of hard time paying attention because my automated teller hasstartedspeakingto me sometimes actually leaving weird messages on the screen in green lettering like Cause a Terrible Scene at Sothebys or Kill the President or Feed Me a Stray Cat and I was freaked out by the park bench that followed me for six blocks last Monday evening and it too spoke to me Disintegration Im taking it in stride Yet the only question I can muster up at first and add to the conversation is a worried Im not going anywhere if we dont have a reservation someplace so do we have a reservation someplace or not I notice that were all drinking dry beers Am I the only one who

cheering together in a friendly way On the screen now are scenes from President Bushs inauguration early this year then a speech from former President Reagan while Patty delivers a hardtohear commentary Soon a tiresome debate forms over whether hes lying or not even though we dont cant hear the words The first and really only one to complain is Price who though I think hes bothered by something else uses this opportunity to vent his frustration looks inappropriately stunned asks How can he lie like that How can he pull thatshit\\n   Oh Christ I moan What shit Now where do we have reservations at I mean Im not really hungry but I would like to have reservations somewhere How about  An afterthought McDermott how did that rate in the new Zagats\\n   No way Farrell complains

behind him Farrell guesses looking up from the Quotrek Because Nancy did it\\n   How can you be so fucking I dont knowcoolabout it Price to whom something really eerie has obviously happened sounds genuinely perplexed Rumor has it that he was in rehab\\n   Some guys are just born cool I guess Farrell smiles shrugging\\n   Im laughing at this answer since Farrell is soobviouslyuncool and Price
